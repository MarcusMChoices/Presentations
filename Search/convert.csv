<p>If you're becoming increasingly forgetful, particularly if you're over the age of 65, it may be a good idea to talk to your GP about the early signs of dementia. </p>
<p>As you get older, you may find that memory loss becomes a problem. It's normal for your memory to be affected by age, stress, tiredness, or certain illnesses and medications. This can be annoying if it happens occasionally, but if it's affecting your daily life or is worrying you or someone you know, you should seek help from your GP.</p>

<h3>How common is dementia?</h3>
<p>According to the <a href=""http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/infographic"">Alzheimer's Society</a> there are around 800,000 people in the UK with dementia. One in three people over 65 will develop dementia, and two-thirds of people with dementia are women.</p>
<p>The number of people with dementia is increasing because people are living longer. It is estimated that by 2021, the number of people with dementia in the UK will have increased to around 1 million.</p>

<h2>What is dementia?</h2>
<p>Dementia is a common condition that affects about 800,000 people in the UK. Your risk of developing dementia increases as you get older, and the condition usually occurs in people over the age of 65.</p>
<p>Dementia is a syndrome (a group of related symptoms) associated with an ongoing decline of the brain and its abilities. This includes problems with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>memory loss </li>
    <li>thinking speed </li>
    <li>mental agility </li>
    <li>language </li>
    <li>understanding </li>
    <li>judgement </li>
</ul>
<p>People with dementia can become apathetic or uninterested in their usual activities, and have problems <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-behaviour.aspx"">controlling their emotions</a>. They may also find social situations challenging, lose interest in <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/relationships-and-dementia.aspx"">socialising</a>, and aspects of their personality may change.</p>
<p>A person with dementia may lose empathy (understanding and compassion), they may see or hear things that other people do not (<a href=""/conditions/psychosis/pages/introduction.aspx"">hallucinations</a>), or they may make false claims or statements. </p>
<p>As dementia affects a person's mental abilities, they may find planning and organising difficult. <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/staying-independent-with-dementia.aspx"">Maintaining their independence</a> may also become a problem. A person with dementia will therefore usually need help from friends or relatives, including help with <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-diagnosis-plan.aspx"">decision making</a>.</p>
<p>Your GP will discuss the possible causes of memory loss with you, including dementia. Other symptoms can include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>increasing difficulties with tasks and activities that require concentration and planning </li>
    <li><a href=""/conditions/depression/pages/introduction.aspx"">depression</a> </li>
    <li>changes in personality and mood </li>
    <li>periods of mental confusion </li>
    <li>difficulty finding the right words </li>
</ul>
<p>Most types of dementia can't be cured, but if it is detected early there are ways you can slow it down and maintain mental function.</p>

<h2>Why is it important to get a diagnosis?</h2>
<p>An early diagnosis can help people with dementia get the right treatment and support, and help those close to them to prepare and plan for the future. With treatment and support, many people are able to <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/living-well-with-dementia.aspx"">lead active, fulfilled lives</a>.</p>

          <h2>Introduction&nbsp;</h2>

          <p><strong>Arthritis is a common condition that causes pain and inflammation in a joint.</strong></p>
<p>In the UK, around 10 million people have arthritis. It affects people of all ages, including children (see below).</p>
<h3>Types of arthritis</h3>
<p>The two most common types of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. </p>
<h4>Osteoarthritis</h4>
<p>Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis in the UK, affecting around 8 million people.</p>
<p>It often develops in people who are over 50 years of age. However, it can occur at any age as a result of an injury or another joint-related condition.</p>
<p>Osteoarthritis initially affects the smooth cartilage lining of the joint. This makes movement more difficult than usual, leading to pain and stiffness.</p>
<p>The cartilage lining of the joint can then thin and tissues within the joint can become more active. This can then lead to swelling and the formation of bony spurs, called osteophytes. </p>
<p>In osteoarthritis, the cartilage (connective tissue) between the bones gradually erodes, causing bone in the joints to rub together. The joints that are most commonly affected are those in the hands, spine, knees and hips.</p>
<p>Read more about <a href=""/conditions/osteoarthritis"">osteoarthritis</a>. </p>
<h4>Rheumatoid arthritis</h4>
<p>In the UK, rheumatoid arthritis affects more than 400,000 people. It often starts when a person is between 40 and 50 years old. Women are three times more likely to be affected than men.</p>
<p>Rheumatoid and osteoarthritis are two different conditions. Rheumatoid osteoarthritis occurs when the body's immune system targets affected joints, which leads to pain and swelling. </p>
<p>The outer covering (synovium) of the joint is the first place affected. This can then spread across the joint, leading to further swelling and a change in the joint's shape. This can cause the bone and cartilage to break down.</p>
<p>People with rheumatoid arthritis can also develop problems with other tissues and organs in their body. </p>

<h3>Symptoms of arthritis</h3>
<p>The symptoms of arthritis you experience will vary depending on the type you have.</p>
<p>This is why it's important to have an accurate diagnosis if you have:</p>
<ul>
    <li>joint pain, tenderness and stiffness </li>
    <li>inflammation in and around the joints </li>
    <li>restricted movement of the joints </li>
    <li>warm, red skin over the affected joint </li>
    <li>weakness and muscle wasting </li>
</ul>
<h3><span id=""juvenile"">Arthritis and children</span></h3>
<p>Arthritis is often associated with older people, but it can also affect children. In the UK, about 15,000 children and young people are affected by arthritis.</p>
<p>Most types of childhood arthritis are known as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). JIA causes pain and inflammation in one or more joints for at least six weeks.</p>
<p>Although the exact cause of JIA is unknown, the symptoms often improve as a child gets older, meaning they can lead a normal life.</p>
<p>The main types of JIA are discussed below. You can also read more about the different <a href=""http://www.arthritisresearchuk.org/arthritis-information/conditions/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/different-types.aspx"">types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis</a> on the <a href=""http://www.arthritisresearchuk.org/"">Arthritis Research UK</a> website.</p>
<h4>Oligo-articular JIA</h4>
<p>Oligo-articular JIA is the most common type of JIA. It affects fewer than five joints in the body <span style=""line-height: 18px; background-color: rgb(255,255,255); font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"">– </span>most commonly in the knees, ankles and wrists.</p>
<p>Oligo-articular JIA has good recovery rates and long-term effects are rare. However, there's a risk that children with the condition may develop eye problems, so regular <a href=""/livewell/eyehealth/pages/videochildrenseyes.aspx"">eye tests</a> with an ophthalmologist (eye care specialist) are recommended.</p>
<h4>Polyarticular JIA (polyarthritis)</h4>
<p>Polyarticular JIA, or polyarthritis, affects five or more joints. It can develop at any age during childhood.</p>
<p>The symptoms of polyarticular JIA are similar to the <a href=""/Conditions/Rheumatoid-arthritis/Pages/Symptoms.aspx"">symptoms of adult rheumatoid arthritis</a>. The condition is often accompanied by a rash and a high temperature of 38°C (100.4°F) or above.</p>
<h4>Systemic onset JIA</h4>
<p>Systemic onset JIA begins with symptoms such as a fever, rash, lethargy (a lack of energy) and enlarged glands. Later on, joints can become swollen and inflamed.</p>
<p>Like polyarticular JIA, systemic onset JIA can affect children of any age.</p>
<h4>Enthesitis-related arthritis</h4>
<p>Enthesitis-related arthritis is a type of juvenile arthritis that affects older boys or teenagers. It can cause pain in the soles of the feet and around the knee and hip joints, where the ligaments attach to the bone.</p>
<h3>Treating arthritis</h3>
<p>There's no cure for arthritis, but there are many treatments that can help slow down the condition.</p>
<p>For osteoarthritis, painkillers, <a href=""/conditions/anti-inflammatories-non-steroidal/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</a> and <a href=""/conditions/Corticosteroid-(drugs)/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">corticosteroids</a> are often prescribed.</p>
<p>In severe cases, the following surgical procedures may be recommended:</p>
<ul>
    <li>arthroplasty (joint replacement) </li>
    <li>arthodesis (joint fusion) </li>
    <li>osteotomy (where a bone is cut and re-aligned) </li>
</ul>
<p>Read more about <a href=""/Conditions/Osteoarthritis/Pages/Treatment.aspx"">how osteoarthritis is treated</a>.</p>
<p>In treating rheumatoid arthritis, the aim is to slow down the condition's progress and minimise damage to the joints. Recommended treatments include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>analgesics (painkillers) </li>
    <li>disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) </li>
    <li><a href=""/conditions/Physiotherapy/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">physiotherapy</a>  </li>

          <h2>Introduction&nbsp;</h2>

          <p><strong>Asthma is a common long-term condition that can cause coughing, wheezing, chest tightness and breathlessness. </strong></p>
<p>The severity of these symptoms varies from person to person. Asthma can be controlled well in most people most of the time, although some people may have more persistent problems.</p>
<p>Occasionally, asthma symptoms can get gradually or suddenly worse. This is known as an ""asthma attack"", although doctors sometimes use the term ""exacerbation"". </p>
<p>Severe attacks may require hospital treatment and can be life threatening, although this is unusual.</p>
<p>Speak to your GP if you think you or your child may have asthma. You should also talk to your doctor or asthma nurse if you have been diagnosed with asthma and you are finding it difficult to control your symptoms.</p>
<p>Read more about the <a href=""/Conditions/Asthma/Pages/Symptoms.aspx"">symptoms of asthma</a> and <a href=""/Conditions/Asthma/Pages/Diagnosis.aspx"">diagnosing asthma</a>.</p>
<h3>What causes asthma?</h3>
<p>Asthma is caused by inflammation of the small tubes, called bronchi, which carry air in and out of the lungs. If you have asthma, the bronchi will be inflamed and more sensitive than normal. </p>
<p>When you come into contact with something that irritates your lungs <span style=""font-size: 13px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #585858; line-height: 18px; background-color: rgb(255,255,255);"">–</span> known as a trigger <span style=""font-size: 13px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #585858; line-height: 18px; background-color: rgb(255,255,255);"">–</span> your airways become narrow, the muscles around them tighten, and there is an increase in the production of sticky mucus (phlegm).</p>
<p>Common asthma triggers include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>house dust mites </li>
    <li>animal fur </li>
    <li>pollen </li>
    <li>cigarette smoke </li>
    <li>exercise </li>
    <li>viral infections </li>
</ul>
<p>Asthma may also be triggered by substances (allergens or chemicals) inhaled while at work. Speak to your GP if you think your symptoms are worse at work and get better on holiday.</p>
<p>The reason why some people develop asthma is not fully understood, although it is known that you are more likely to develop it if you have a family history of the condition. </p>
<p>Asthma can develop at any age, including in young children and elderly people.</p>
<p>Read more about the <a href=""/Conditions/Asthma/Pages/Causes.aspx"">causes of asthma</a>.  </p>
<h3>Who is affected?</h3>
<p>In the UK, around 5.4 million people are currently receiving treatment for asthma. </p>
<p>That's the equivalent of 1 in every 12 adults and 1 in every 11 children. Asthma in adults is more common in women than men.</p>
<h3>How asthma is treated</h3>
<p>While there is no cure for asthma, there are a number of treatments that can help control the condition. </p>
<p>Treatment is based on two important goals, which are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>relieving symptoms  </li>
    <li>preventing future symptoms and attacks </li>
</ul>
<p>For most people, this will involve the occasional <span style=""font-size: 13px; font-family: arial; color: #585858;"">–</span> or, more commonly, daily <span style=""font-size: 13px; font-family: arial; color: #585858;"">–</span> use of medications, usually taken using an inhaler. However, identifying and avoiding possible triggers is also important.</p>
<p>You should have a personal asthma action plan agreed with your doctor or nurse that includes information about the medicines you need to take, how to recognise when your symptoms are getting worse, and what steps to take when they do so.</p>
<p>Read more about <a href=""/Conditions/Asthma/Pages/Treatment.aspx"">treating asthma</a> and <a href=""/Conditions/Asthma/Pages/living-with.aspx"">living with asthma</a>.</p>
<h3>Outlook</h3>
<p>For many people, asthma is a long-term condition <span style=""font-size: small; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #585858; line-height: 18px; background-color: rgb(255,255,255);"">– </span>particularly if it first develops in adulthood.</p>
<p>Asthma symptoms are usually controllable and reversible with treatment, although some people with long-lasting asthma may develop permanent narrowing of their airways and more persistent problems.  </p>
<p>For children diagnosed with asthma, the condition may disappear or improve during the teenage years, although it can return later in life. Moderate or severe childhood asthma is more likely to persist or return later on.</p>

          <h2>Introduction&nbsp;</h2>

          <p><strong>Back pain is a common problem that affects most people at some point in their life.</strong></p>
<p>It may be triggered by bad posture while sitting or standing, bending awkwardly, or lifting incorrectly. It’s not generally caused by a serious condition. Find out more about the <a href=""/Conditions/Back-pain/Pages/Causes.aspx"">causes of back pain</a>.</p>
<p>In most cases, back pain will improve in a few weeks or months, although some people experience long-term pain or pain that keeps coming back. </p>
<h3>Types of back pain</h3>
<p>Backache is most common in the lower back ('lumbago'), although it can be felt anywhere along your spine, from your neck down to your hips. Read information on <a href=""/Conditions/Neck-pain/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">neck pain</a> and <a href=""/Conditions/shoulderpain/Pages/introduction.aspx"">shoulder pain</a>, which are covered separately. </p>
<p>Sometimes, back pain can be caused by an injury or disease, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>a <a href=""/Conditions/Slipped-disc/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">slipped disc</a> – when one of the discs in the spine is damaged and presses on the nerves </li>
    <li><a href=""/conditions/sciatica/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">sciatica</a> – irritation or compression of the sciatic nerve, which causes pain, numbness and tingling that travels down one leg </li>

    <li><a href=""/Conditions/Frozen-shoulder/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">frozen shoulder</a> – inflammation around the shoulder that causes pain and stiffness </li>
    <li><a href=""/Conditions/Ankylosing-spondylitis/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">ankylosing spondylitis</a> – a long-term condition that causes pain and stiffness where the spine meets the pelvis </li>
</ul>
<p>The rest of this information will focus on back pain that doesn’t have an obvious cause. Doctors call this “non-specific back pain”.</p>
<h3>What to do</h3>
<p>Most cases of back pain get better on their own and you may not need to see a doctor. </p>
<p>If you’ve only had back pain for a few days or weeks, the following advice may help relieve your symptoms and speed up your recovery:</p>
<ul>
    <li>remain as active as possible and try to continue with your daily activities </li>
    <li>take over-the-counter painkillers, such as <a href=""/medicine-guides/pages/MedicineOverview.aspx?condition=Pain&amp;medicine=Paracetamol&amp;preparation=Paracetamol%20500mg%20tablets"">paracetamol</a> or <a href=""/conditions/Painkillers-ibuprofen/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">ibuprofen</a> if you feel you need to </li>
    <li>use hot or cold compression packs – you can buy these from your local pharmacy, or a bag of frozen vegetables and a hot water bottle will work just as well </li>
</ul>
<p>Although it can be difficult to be cheerful or optimistic if you are in pain, it’s important to stay positive because this can help you recover faster.</p>

<h3>Treatments for long-term back pain</h3>
<p>If you’re worried about your back or your pain hasn’t improved by around six weeks, it’s a good idea to visit your GP, who can advise you about the treatments available.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>stronger painkillers </li>
    <li>exercise classes – where you are taught specific exercises to strengthen your muscles and improve your posture </li>
    <li>manual therapy, such as <a href=""/conditions/physiotherapy/pages/introduction.aspx"">physiotherapy</a>, <a href=""/conditions/chiropractic/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">chiropractic</a> or <a href=""/conditions/Osteopathy/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">osteopathy</a> </li>
    <li><a href=""/conditions/Acupuncture/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">acupuncture</a> </li>
    <li>counselling, such as <a href=""/conditions/cognitive-behavioural-therapy/pages/introduction.aspx"">cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)</a> </li>
    <li>support and advice at a specialist pain clinic </li>
</ul>
<p>Some people choose to see a therapist for manual therapy or acupuncture without seeing their GP first. If you want to do this you will usually need to pay for private treatment, which is likely to cost around £30-50 for each appointment.</p>
<p>Spinal surgery is usually only recommended when all else has failed. </p>

<h3>Preventing back pain </h3>
<p>How you sit, stand, lie and lift can all affect the health of your back. </p>
<p>Try to avoid placing too much pressure on your back and ensure it's strong and supple. Regular exercise, such as walking and <a href=""/Livewell/getting-started-guides/Pages/getting-started-swimming.aspx"">swimming</a>, is an excellent way of preventing back pain. </p>
<p>Activities such as <a href=""/Livewell/fitness/Pages/yoga.aspx"">yoga</a> or <a href=""/Livewell/fitness/Pages/pilates.aspx"">pilates</a> can improve your flexibility and strengthen your back muscles. </p>

          <h2>Introduction&nbsp;</h2>

          <p><strong>Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in the UK.</strong></p>
<p>In 2011, just under 50,000 women were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. Most women who get it (8 out of 10) are over 50, but younger women, and in rare cases, men, can also get breast cancer.</p>
<p>If it's treated early enough, breast cancer can be prevented from spreading to other parts of the body.</p>
<h3>The breasts</h3>
<p>The breasts are made up of fat, connective tissue and thousands of tiny glands called lobules, which produce milk. When a woman has a baby, the milk is delivered to the nipple through tiny tubes called ducts, which allow her to breastfeed.</p>
<p>The body is made up of billions of tiny cells, which usually grow and multiply in an orderly way. New cells are only produced when and where they're needed. In cancer, this orderly process goes wrong and cells begin to grow and multiply uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Read more about the <a href=""/Conditions/Cancer-of-the-breast-female/Pages/Causes.aspx"">causes of breast cancer</a>. </p>
<h3>Symptoms of breast cancer</h3>
<p>Breast cancer can have a number of symptoms, but the first noticeable symptom is usually a lump or area of thickened breast tissue.</p>
<p>Most <a href=""/conditions/Breast-lump/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">breast lumps</a> aren't cancerous, but it's always best to have them checked by your doctor. You should also see your GP if you notice any of the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>a change in the size or shape of one or both breasts </li>
    <li><a href=""/conditions/nipple-discharge/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">discharge from either of your nipples</a> (which may be streaked with blood) </li>
    <li>a lump or swelling in either of your armpits </li>
    <li>dimpling on the skin of your breasts </li>
    <li>a rash on or around your nipple </li>
    <li>a change in the appearance of your nipple, such as becoming sunken into your breast </li>
</ul>
<p>Breast pain isn't usually a symptom of breast cancer.</p>
<p>Learn more about the <a href=""/Conditions/Cancer-of-the-breast-female/Pages/Symptoms.aspx"">symptoms of breast cancer</a>.</p>
<p>After examining your breasts, your GP may refer you to a specialist breast cancer clinic for further tests. This might include a mammography (breast screening) or a <a href=""/conditions/Biopsy/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">biopsy</a>. </p>
<p>Read more about <a href=""/conditions/breast-cancer-screening/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">breast screening</a> and <a href=""/Conditions/Cancer-of-the-breast-female/Pages/Diagnosis.aspx"">how breast cancer is diagnosed</a>.</p>
<h3>Types of breast cancer</h3>
<p>There are several different types of breast cancer, which can develop in different parts of the breast. Breast cancer is often divided into non-invasive and invasive types.</p>
<h4>Non-invasive breast cancer </h4>
<p>Non-invasive breast cancer is also known as cancer or carcinoma in situ. This cancer is found in the ducts of the breast and hasn't developed the ability to spread outside the breast.</p>
<p>This form of cancer rarely shows as a lump in the breast that can be felt, and is usually found on a mammogram (see below).<strong> </strong>The most common type of non-invasive cancer is ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).</p>
<h4>Invasive breast cancer</h4>
<p>Invasive cancer has the ability to spread outside the breast, although this doesn't necessarily mean it has spread.</p>
<p>The most common form of breast cancer is invasive ductal breast cancer, which develops in the cells that line the breast ducts. Invasive ductal breast cancer accounts for about 80% of all breast cancer cases and is sometimes called ""no special type"". </p>
<h4>Other types of breast cancer</h4>
<p>Other less common types of breast cancer include invasive lobular breast cancer, which develops in the cells that line the milk-producing lobules, inflammatory breast cancer and <a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pagets-disease-of-the-nipple/Pages/introduction.aspx"">Paget's disease of the breast</a>.</p>
<p>It's possible for breast cancer to spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymph nodes (small glands that filter bacteria from the body) or the bloodstream. If this happens, it's known as ""secondary"" or ""metastatic"" breast cancer.</p>
<h3>Breast cancer screening</h3>
<p>About one in eight women are diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime. There's a good chance of recovery if it's detected in its early stages. For this reason, it's vital that women check their breasts regularly for any changes and always get any changes examined by their GP.</p>
<p>Mammographic screening (where <a href=""/conditions/X-ray/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">X-ray</a> images of the breast are taken) is the best available method of detecting an early breast lesion. However, you should be aware that a mammogram might fail to detect some breast cancers. It might also increase your chances of having extra tests and interventions, including surgery.</p>
<p>Women with a higher-than-average risk of developing breast cancer may be offered screening and genetic testing for the condition.</p>
<p>As the risk of breast cancer increases with age, all women who are 50-70 years old are invited for breast cancer screening every three years.</p>
<p>Women over 70 are also entitled to screening and can arrange an appointment through their GP or local screening unit.</p>
<p>The NHS is in the process of extending the programme as a trial, offering screening to some women aged 47-73.</p>

<h3>Treating breast cancer</h3>
<p>If cancer is detected at an early stage, it can be treated before it spreads to nearby parts of the body.</p>
<p>Breast cancer is treated using a combination of surgery, <a href=""/Conditions/Chemotherapy/Pages/Definition.aspx?url=Pages/What-is-it.aspx"">chemotherapy</a> and <a href=""/conditions/Radiotherapy/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">radiotherapy</a>. Surgery is usually the first type of treatment you'll have, followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy or, in some cases, hormone or biological treatments.</p>
<p>The type of surgery and the treatment you have afterwards will depend on the type of breast cancer you have. Your doctor will discuss the best treatment plan with you.</p>
<p>Read a document listing the one-year net survival estimates by CCG for breast cancer</p>
<p>In a small proportion of women, breast cancer is discovered after it's spread to other parts of the body (metastasis). Secondary cancer, also called advanced or metastatic cancer, isn't curable, so the aim of treatment is to achieve remission (symptom relief).</p>

<h4>How well your local NHS performs</h4>
<p>Clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) are NHS organisations that organise the delivery of NHS services in England. They play a major role in achieving good health outcomes for the local population that they serve.</p>
<p>You can now <a href=""http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/business-transparency/freedom-of-information/what-can-i-request/published-ad-hoc-data/health/march-2015/breast--colorectal-and-lung-cancer-survival-by-ccg--2008-to-2012.pdf"">check how your local CCG compares against others for breast cancer survival</a> (PDF, 900 Kb).</p>
<h3>Preventing breast cancer</h3>
<p>As the causes of breast cancer aren't fully understood, it's not possible to know if it can be prevented altogether.</p>
<p>If you're at increased risk of developing the condition, some treatments are available to reduce the risk.</p>
<p>Studies have looked at the link between breast cancer and diet and, although there are no definite conclusions, there are benefits for women who maintain a <a href=""/Livewell/Loseweight/Pages/Loseweighthome.aspx"">healthy weight</a>, <a href=""/LiveWell/Fitness/Pages/Fitnesshome.aspx"">exercise regularly</a> and who have a low intake of saturated <a href=""/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/Fat.aspx"">fat</a> and <a href=""/Livewell/Alcohol/Pages/Alcoholhome.aspx"">alcohol</a>.</p>
<p>It's been suggested that regular exercise can reduce your risk of breast cancer by as much as a third. If you've been through the menopause, it's particularly important that you're not overweight or obese. This is because being overweight or obese causes more oestrogen to be produced, which can increase the risk of breast cancer.</p>

<h3>Living with breast cancer</h3>
<p>Being diagnosed with breast cancer can affect daily life in many ways, depending on what stage it's at and what treatment you're having.</p>
<p>How women cope with their diagnosis and treatment varies from person to person. You can be reassured that there are several forms of support available, if you need it. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>your family and friends can be a powerful support system </li>
    <li>you can communicate with other people in the same situation </li>
    <li>find out as much as possible about your condition </li>
    <li>don't try to do too much or overexert yourself </li>
    <li>make time for yourself </li>
</ul>

              <h3>OPERA</h3>
<p>If you're concerned about your risk of developing inherited breast cancer, you can use <a href=""http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Cancerinformation/Causesriskfactors/Genetics/OPERA.aspx"">Macmillan's online interactive assessment tool</a>, known as OPERA (Online Personal Education and Risk Assessment).</p>
<p>OPERA is based on the <a href=""http://www.nice.org.uk/"">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)</a> guidelines for the <a href=""http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/CG164"">classification and care of women at risk of familial breast cancer</a>.</p>
<p>The tool can be used to assess a person's risk of developing the condition based on their family history of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. This is because the genes that are mainly responsible for breast cancer are also linked to ovarian cancer.</p>

          <h2>Introduction&nbsp;</h2>

          <p><strong>Diabetes is a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high.</strong></p>
<p>There are two main types of diabetes – <a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Diabetes-type1/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">type 1 diabetes</a> and <a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Diabetes-type2/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">type 2 diabetes</a>. </p>
<p>In 2010, there were approximately 3.1 million people aged 16 or over with diabetes (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) in England. </p>
<p>By 2030, this figure is expected to rise to 4.6 million, with 90% of those affected having type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>The charity Diabetes UK estimates that around 850,000 people in England have diabetes but haven't been diagnosed.</p>
<p>Many more people have blood sugar levels above the normal range, but not high enough to be diagnosed as having diabetes. </p>
<p>This is sometimes known as prediabetes. If your blood sugar level is above the normal range, your risk of developing full-blown diabetes is increased.</p>
<p>It's very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as early as possible because it will get progressively worse if left untreated.</p>
<p>You should therefore visit your GP as soon as possible if you have symptoms, such as feeling thirsty, passing urine more often than usual, and feeling tired all the time.</p>
<h3>Symptoms of diabetes</h3>
<p>The main symptoms of diabetes are: </p>
<ul>
    <li>feeling very <a href=""/Conditions/thirst/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">thirsty</a> </li>
    <li>urinating more frequently than usual, particularly at night </li>
    <li>feeling very tired </li>
    <li>weight loss and loss of muscle bulk </li>
    <li>itching around the penis or vagina, or frequent episodes of <a href=""/conditions/Thrush/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">thrush</a> </li>
    <li>cuts or wounds that heal slowly </li>
    <li>blurred vision (caused by the lens of the eye becoming dry) </li>
</ul>
<p>Type 1 diabetes can develop quickly over weeks or even days.</p>
<p>Many people have type 2 diabetes for years without realising because the early symptoms tend to be general.</p>
<h3>What causes diabetes?</h3>
<p>The amount of sugar in the blood is controlled by a hormone called insulin, which is produced by the pancreas (a gland behind the stomach).</p>
<p>When food is digested and enters your bloodstream, insulin moves glucose out of the blood and into cells, where it's broken down to produce energy.</p>
<p>However, if you have diabetes, your body is unable to break down glucose into energy. This is because there's either not enough insulin to move the glucose, or the insulin produced doesn't work properly.</p>
<h3>Type 1 diabetes</h3>
<p>In type 1 diabetes, the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin. As no insulin is produced, your glucose levels increase, which can seriously damage the body's organs.</p>
<p>Type 1 diabetes is often known as insulin-dependent diabetes. It's also sometimes known as juvenile diabetes or early-onset diabetes because it usually develops before the age of 40, often during the teenage years.</p>
<p>Type 1 diabetes is less common than type 2 diabetes. In the UK, it affects about 10% of all adults with diabetes.</p>
<p>If you're diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, you'll need insulin injections for the rest of your life. </p>
<p>You'll also need to pay close attention to certain aspects of your lifestyle and health to ensure your blood glucose levels stay balanced. </p>
<p>For example, you'll need to <a href=""/Livewell/healthy-eating/Pages/Healthyeating.aspx"">eat healthily</a>, take <a href=""/LiveWell/Fitness/Pages/Fitnesshome.aspx"">regular exercise</a> and carry out regular blood tests.</p>

<h3><span id=""#type2"">Type 2 diabetes</span></h3>
<p>Type 2 diabetes is where the body doesn't produce enough insulin, or the body's cells don't react to insulin. This is known as insulin resistance. </p>
<p>Type 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1 diabetes. In the UK, around 90% of all adults with diabetes have type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>If you're diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, you may be able to control your symptoms simply by eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and monitoring your blood glucose levels. </p>
<p>However, as type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition, you may eventually need medication, usually in the form of tablets.</p>
<p>Type 2 diabetes is often associated with <a href=""/conditions/Obesity/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">obesity</a>. Obesity-related diabetes is sometimes referred to as maturity-onset diabetes because it's more common in older people.</p>
<p>You can use the <a href=""/Tools/Pages/Healthyweightcalculator.aspx?Tag="">BMI healthy weight calculator</a> to check whether you're a healthy weight.</p>

<h3>Diabetic eye screening</h3>
<p>Everyone with diabetes aged 12 or over should be invited to have their eyes screened once a year. </p>
<p>If you have diabetes, your eyes are at risk from diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to sight loss if it's not treated. </p>
<p>Screening, which involves a half-hour check to examine the back of the eyes, is a way of detecting the condition early so it can be treated more effectively. </p>
<p>Read more about <a href=""/Conditions/Diabetes/Pages/diabetic-eye-screening.aspx"">diabetic eye screening</a>.</p>
<h3>Gestational diabetes (in pregnancy)</h3>
<p>During pregnancy, some women have such high levels of blood glucose that their body is unable to produce enough insulin to absorb it all. This is known as gestational diabetes and affects up to 18 in 100 women during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Pregnancy can also make existing type 1 diabetes worse. Gestational diabetes can increase the risk of health problems developing in an unborn baby, so it's important to keep your blood glucose levels under control. </p>
<p>In most cases, gestational diabetes develops during the second trimester of pregnancy (weeks 14 to 26) and disappears after the baby is born. </p>
<p>However, women who have gestational diabetes are at an increased risk (30%) of developing type 2 diabetes later in life (compared with a 10% risk for the general population). </p>

<p>If you're becoming increasingly forgetful, particularly if you're over the age of 65, it may be a good idea to talk to your GP about the early signs of dementia. </p>
<p>As you get older, you may find that memory loss becomes a problem. It's normal for your memory to be affected by age, stress, tiredness, or certain illnesses and medications. This can be annoying if it happens occasionally, but if it's affecting your daily life or is worrying you or someone you know, you should seek help from your GP.</p>
<div class=""onecol-snippet-right"">
<h3>How common is dementia?</h3>
<p>According to the <a href=""http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/infographic"">Alzheimer's Society</a> there are around 800,000 people in the UK with dementia. One in three people over 65 will develop dementia, and two-thirds of people with dementia are women.</p>
<p>The number of people with dementia is increasing because people are living longer. It is estimated that by 2021, the number of people with dementia in the UK will have increased to around 1 million.</p>

<h2>What is dementia?</h2>
<p>Dementia is a common condition that affects about 800,000 people in the UK. Your risk of developing dementia increases as you get older, and the condition usually occurs in people over the age of 65.</p>
<p>Dementia is a syndrome (a group of related symptoms) associated with an ongoing decline of the brain and its abilities. This includes problems with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>memory loss </li>
    <li>thinking speed </li>
    <li>mental agility </li>
    <li>language </li>
    <li>understanding </li>
    <li>judgement </li>
</ul>
<p>People with dementia can become apathetic or uninterested in their usual activities, and have problems <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-behaviour.aspx"">controlling their emotions</a>. They may also find social situations challenging, lose interest in <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/relationships-and-dementia.aspx"">socialising</a>, and aspects of their personality may change.</p>
<p>A person with dementia may lose empathy (understanding and compassion), they may see or hear things that other people do not (<a href=""/conditions/psychosis/pages/introduction.aspx"">hallucinations</a>), or they may make false claims or statements. </p>
<p>As dementia affects a person's mental abilities, they may find planning and organising difficult. <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/staying-independent-with-dementia.aspx"">Maintaining their independence</a> may also become a problem. A person with dementia will therefore usually need help from friends or relatives, including help with <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-diagnosis-plan.aspx"">decision making</a>.</p>
<p>Your GP will discuss the possible causes of memory loss with you, including dementia. Other symptoms can include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>increasing difficulties with tasks and activities that require concentration and planning </li>
    <li><a href=""/conditions/depression/pages/introduction.aspx"">depression</a> </li>
    <li>changes in personality and mood </li>
    <li>periods of mental confusion </li>
    <li>difficulty finding the right words </li>
</ul>
<p>Most types of dementia can't be cured, but if it is detected early there are ways you can slow it down and maintain mental function.</p>

          <h2>Introduction&nbsp;</h2>

          <p><strong>Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death both in the UK and worldwide.</strong></p>
<p>It's responsible for more than 73,000 deaths in the UK each year. About 1 in 6 men and 1 in 10 women die from CHD.</p>
<p>In the UK, there are an estimated 2.3 million people living with CHD and around 2 million people affected by <a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Angina/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">angina</a> (the most common symptom of coronary heart disease). </p>
<p>CHD generally affects more men than women, although from the age of 50 the chances of developing the condition are similar for both sexes.</p>
<p>As well as angina (chest pain), the main symptoms of CHD are <a href=""/conditions/heart-attack/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">heart attacks</a> and <a href=""/conditions/Heart-failure/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">heart failure</a>. However, not everyone has the same symptoms and some people may not have any before CHD is diagnosed.</p>
<p>CHD is sometimes called ischaemic heart disease.</p>

<h3>The heart</h3>
<p>The heart is a muscle about the size of your fist. It pumps blood around your body and beats approximately 70 times a minute. After the blood leaves the right side of the heart, it goes to your lungs where it picks up oxygen.</p>
<p>The oxygen-rich blood returns to your heart and is then pumped to the body's organs through a network of arteries. The blood returns to your heart through veins before being pumped back to your lungs again. This process is called circulation.</p>
<p>The heart gets its own supply of blood from a network of blood vessels on the heart's surface called coronary arteries.</p>
<h3>What causes coronary heart disease?</h3>
<p>Coronary heart disease is the term that describes what happens when your heart's blood supply is blocked or interrupted by a build-up of fatty substances in the coronary arteries.</p>
<p>Over time, the walls of your arteries can become furred up with fatty deposits. This process is known as <a href=""/Conditions/Atherosclerosis/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">atherosclerosis</a> and the fatty deposits are called atheroma. </p>
<p>Atherosclerosis can be caused by lifestyle factors and other conditions, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>smoking </li>

<h3>Diagnosing coronary heart disease</h3>
<p>If your doctor feels you're at risk of CHD, they may carry out a risk assessment. This involves asking about your medical and family history, your lifestyle and taking a <a href=""/conditions/Blood-tests/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">blood test</a>.</p>
<p>Further tests may be needed to confirm a diagnosis of CHD, including:</p>
<ul>

<h3>Treating coronary heart disease</h3>
<p>Coronary heart disease can't be cured but treatment can help manage the symptoms and reduce the chances of problems such as heart attacks.</p>
<p>Treatment can include lifestyle changes, such as <a href=""/livewell/fitness/Pages/Fitnesshome.aspx"">regular exercise</a> and <a href=""/livewell/smoking/Pages/stopsmokingnewhome.aspx"">stopping smoking</a>, as well as medication and surgery.</p>

          <h2>Introduction&nbsp;</h2>

          <p><strong>Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can be very unpleasant and can sometimes lead to serious complications. </strong><strong>However, it's now uncommon in the UK because of the effectiveness of the MMR vaccination.</strong></p>
<p>The initial symptoms of measles develop around 10 days after you are infected. These can include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>cold-like symptoms </li>
    <li>red eyes and sensitivity to light </li>
    <li>a high temperature (fever) </li>
    <li>greyish white spots in the mouth and throat </li>
</ul>
<p>After a few days, a red-brown spotty rash will appear. This usually starts behind the ears and then spreads around the head and neck before spreading to the rest of the body.</p>
<p>Read more about the <a href=""/Conditions/Measles/Pages/Symptoms.aspx"">symptoms of measles</a>.</p>
<h3>When to see your GP</h3>
<p>You should contact your GP as soon as possible if you suspect that you or your child may have measles.</p>
<p>It's best to phone before your visit as your GP surgery may need to make arrangements to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others. </p>
<p>Your GP will usually be able to diagnose measles from the combination of symptoms, although a sample of your saliva may be tested to confirm the diagnosis.</p>
<h3>How measles is spread</h3>
<p>The measles virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when an infected person coughs or sneezes. </p>
<p>You can easily catch measles by breathing in these droplets or, if the droplets have settled on a surface, by touching the surface and then placing your hands near your nose or mouth. The measles virus can survive on surfaces for a few hours.</p>
<p>When inside your body, the virus multiplies in the back of your throat and lungs before spreading throughout your body.</p>
<p>People with measles are infectious from when the first symptoms develop until about four days after the rash first appears. Therefore, school or work should be avoided for at least four days from when the rash first appeared to limit the spread of infection.</p>
<h3>Who is affected</h3>
<p>Anyone can get measles if they haven't been vaccinated or they haven't had it before, although it's most common in children between one and four years old.</p>
<p>Once you have had measles, it is very rare to develop the infection again in the future because your body builds up immunity (resistance) to the virus.</p>
<h3>How to prevent measles</h3>
<p>The most effective way of preventing measles is to have the <a href=""/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/mmr-vaccine.aspx"">measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine</a>.</p>
<p>The first MMR vaccination is routinely given when your child is around 13 months old and a second is given before your child starts school. </p>
<p>Adults and 6-13 month old children can also have the MMR vaccine if they are at risk of catching measles. For example, vaccination may be recommended if there is an outbreak of measles in your local area, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has measles.</p>
<p>Read more about <a href=""/Conditions/Measles/Pages/Prevention.aspx"">preventing measles</a>.</p>
<h3>Treating measles</h3>
<p>There's no specific treatment for measles, but your immune system should fight off the infection within 7-10 days. </p>
<p>There are several things you can do to help make your recovery more comfortable, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>closing the curtains to help reduce light sensitivity </li>
    <li>using damp cotton wool to clean the eyes </li>
    <li>taking <a href=""/conditions/Painkillers-paracetamol/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">paracetamol</a> or <a href=""/Conditions/Painkillers-ibuprofen/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">ibuprofen</a> to relieve fever, aches and pains (aspirin should not be given to children under 16 years old) </li>
    <li>drinking plenty of water to avoid <a href=""/Conditions/dehydration/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">dehydration</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>In severe cases of measles, especially if there are complications, you may need to be admitted to hospital for treatment. </p>
<p>Read more about <a href=""/Conditions/Measles/Pages/Treatment.aspx"">treating measles</a>.</p>
<h3>Complications of measles</h3>
<p>Measles can lead to very serious complications that can sometimes be fatal. These include bacterial infection in the lungs (<a href=""/conditions/pneumonia/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">pneumonia</a>) and the brain (<a href=""/Conditions/encephalitis/Pages/introduction.aspx"">encephalitis</a>).</p>
<p>People most at risk of developing serious complications include babies younger than 12 months, children in poor health, teenagers and adults.</p>
<p>It's estimated that around one in every 5,000 people with measles will die as a result of a serious complication.</p>

              <h3>How common is measles?</h3>
<p>The success of the MMR vaccine means that cases of measles are uncommon in the UK. However, the number of cases has risen in recent years and there have been some high-profile outbreaks.</p>
<p>For example, between November 2012 and July 2013 there was a measles outbreak in and around Swansea, during which more than 1,200 cases were reported.</p>
<p>It is thought that the rise in the number of cases of measles is largely due to parents not getting their child vaccinated with the MMR vaccine, probably due to speculation linking MMR to autism.</p>
<p>Publicity in 1998 highlighted a report claiming a link between the MMR jab and autism. However, numerous studies that were undertaken to investigate this claim found <a href=""/news/2007/January08/Pages/MMRvaccinedoesnotcauseautism.aspx"">no link between the MMR vaccine and autism</a>.</p>

<p>The <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/nhs-health-check/Pages/What-is-an-NHS-Health-Check.aspx"" shape=""rect"">NHS Health Check</a> is your chance to get your free midlife MOT. For adults in England aged 40-74 without a pre-existing condition, it checks your circulatory and vascular health and what your risk of getting a disabling vascular disease is. This guide explains what happens at the check, when and how you get one, and how to lower your risk.</p>

<p class=""headertitle"">How do I get an NHS Health Check? </p>
<p>If you're in the 40-74 age group without a pre-existing condition, you can expect to receive a letter from your GP or local authority inviting you for a free NHS Health Check. Don't worry if you haven't got your invitation yet, as you will be invited for one over the next few years. In the meantime, there are <a href=""/Conditions/nhs-health-check/Pages/How-do-I-get-an-NHS-Health-Check.aspx"">other ways of getting your health checked</a>. </p>

<p class=""headertitle"">Why should I get checked?</p>
<p>As we get older, we have a higher risk of developing something dangerous like high blood pressure, heart disease or type 2 diabetes. Your NHS Health Check can <a href=""/Conditions/nhs-health-check/Pages/Why-have-an-NHS-Health-Check.aspx"">spot early signs</a> and help prevent these happening to you, which means you'll be more likely to enjoy life for longer. Start by taking the online <a href=""/Conditions/nhs-health-check/Pages/check-your-heart-age-tool.aspx"">heart age test</a> to see how healthy your heart is.</p>

<p>The online clinic service enables you to get quick answers to your personal medical problems from specialists, including consultants, GPs, nurses and other clinicians.</p>
<p>A new clinic begins each month on a different topic. The online clinics are hosted by <span style=""text-decoration:underline""><a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/online-clinics/Pages/clinic-partners.aspx"" shape=""rect"">talkhealth</a></span> and supported by a range of charities.</p>
<p>In the latest clinic, <a href=""http://www.talkhealthpartnership.com/online_clinics/online_clinic_on_sun_damaged_skin_and_skin_cancer_2015.php"">the online clinic on sun-damaged skin and skin cancer 2015</a>, questions are answered from May 4-8. </p>
<p>The clinics are in a forum format where you can post your questions, anonymously if you wish, and get answers, often on the same day when the clinic is open. You can  also post questions a few days in advance of the clinics opening and set up a reminder so you can see when an expert has posted an answer.</p>

<h2>The effects of flu</h2>
<p><a href=""/Conditions/Flu/Pages/Symptoms.aspx"">Flu symptoms</a> can hit quite suddenly and severely. They usually include fever, chills, headaches and aching muscles. You can often get a cough and sore throat.</p>
<p>Because flu is caused by a virus and not bacteria, antibiotics won't treat it.</p>
<p>Anyone can get flu, but it can be more serious for certain people, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>people aged 65 or over </li>
    <li>people who have a serious medical condition </li>
    <li>people who are very overweight</li>
    <li>pregnant women  </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are in one of these groups, you're more vulnerable to the effects of flu (even if you're fit and healthy) and could develop <a href=""/Conditions/Flu/Pages/Complications.aspx"">flu complications</a>, which are more serious illnesses such as <a shape=""rect"" href=""/conditions/Bronchitis/Pages/Introduction.aspx"" shape=""rect"">bronchitis</a> and <a shape=""rect"" href=""/conditions/Pneumonia/Pages/Introduction.aspx"" shape=""rect"">pneumonia</a>, which could result in hospitalisation. </p>
<p>Flu can also make existing medical conditions worse.</p>

<h2>Should you have the flu jab?</h2>

<ul>
    <li>a serious heart complaint </li>
    <li>you are very overweight with a BMI over 40</li>

                        </h3>
                    <p>Yes, you can pay for the flu vaccination privately if you’re unable to have it on the NHS. It is available from some pharmacies and GPs on a private patient basis</p>

                </div>
            <h2>Pregnant women and the flu jab</h2>
<p>If you're pregnant, you should have the flu jab, regardless of the stage of pregnancy you've reached. Pregnant women are more prone to complications from flu that can cause serious illness for both mother and baby.</p>
<p>If you are pregnant and catch flu, talk to your GP urgently as you may need treatment with antiviral medicine.</p>
<p>Read more about the <a href=""/Conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/Pages/flu-jab-vaccine-pregnant.aspx"">flu jab in pregnancy</a>.</p>
<h2>Children and the flu vaccine</h2>
<p>The <a href=""/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/child-flu-vaccine.aspx"">flu vaccine for children</a> is a nasal spray and is available each year on the NHS for two-, three- and four-year-olds plus children in school years one and two.</p>
<p>Over time, as the programme rolls out, all children between the ages of two and 16 will be vaccinated against flu each year with the nasal spray.</p>
<p>Children with a long-term health condition should also have a flu vaccination because their illness could get worse if they catch flu. This includes any child over the age of six months of age with a long-term health problem such as a serious respiratory or neurological condition. </p>
<p>If you have a child with a long-term condition, speak to your GP about whether they should have the flu vaccination. Some children with a long-term health condition may be advised to have the flu vaccine injection rather than the nasal spray.</p>
<h2>Carers and the flu jab</h2>
<p>If you’re the carer of an elderly or disabled person, make sure they’ve had their flu jab. As a carer, you could be eligible for a flu jab too. Ask your GP for advice, or read our information about <a shape=""rect"" href=""/carersdirect/yourself/takingcareofyourself/pages/flujabsforcarers.aspx"" shape=""rect"">Flu jabs for carers</a>.</p>
<h2>How the flu vaccine works</h2>
<p>The injected flu vaccine contains inactivated strains of the flu virus and therefore cannot cause flu. </p>
<p>The nasal spray flu vaccine for children contains live, but weakened forms of flu virus but again this vaccine does not cause flu. </p>
<p>The flu virus in both the injected and nasal spray vaccine is grown on fertilised hens' eggs so anyone with a known egg allergy should be given an alternative egg-free vaccine.</p>

<p>Read more about how the <a href=""/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/child-flu-vaccine.aspx"">children's flu nasal vaccine works</a>.</p>
<span id=""UniqueID1347443622690"">
<h2>How to get the flu vaccine</h2>
<p>If you think you or your child needs a flu vaccination, check with your GP, practice nurse or your local pharmacist. </p>
<p>The best time of the year to have a <a href=""/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/flu-influenza-vaccine.aspx"">flu vaccination</a> is in the autumn from the beginning of October to early November. Most GP surgeries arrange flu vaccination clinics around this time. It’s free and it's effective against the latest flu virus strains. </p>
<p>Even if you've already had a flu vaccine in previous years, you need another one each year. The flu vaccine may only protect you for a year because the viruses that cause flu are always changing. </p>
<span id=""UniqueID1347443622689"">
<h2>The pneumococcal vaccine</h2>
<p>When you see your GP for a flu jab, ask whether you also need the pneumococcal vaccine, which protects you against some forms of pneumococcal infection including pneumonia.</p>
<p>Like the flu jab, the pneumococcal vaccine (also known as the pneumonia vaccine or &quot;pneumo jab&quot;) is available free on the NHS to everyone aged 65 or over, and for younger people with some serious medical conditions. But it's a one-off jab rather than an annual one.</p>
<p>Find out if you should have the <a href=""/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/when-is-pneumococcal-vaccine-needed.aspx"">pneumococcal vaccine</a>.</p>
</span>
<h2>How effective is the flu jab?</h2>
<p>No vaccine is 100% effective, however, people who have had the flu jab are less likely to get flu. If you do get flu despite having the jab, it will probably be milder than if you haven’t been vaccinated.</p>
</span>
<h2>Flu jab side effects</h2>
<span id=""UniqueID1347443622690"">
<p>The flu jab doesn’t cause flu as it doesn’t contain live viruses. However, you may experience side effects after having the jab, such as a temperature and aching muscles for a couple of days afterwards. Your arm may feel sore at the site where you were injected. More severe reactions are rare.</p>
<p>The flu vaccine only protects against flu, but not other illnesses caused by other viruses, such as the <a shape=""rect"" href=""/conditions/Cold-common/Pages/Introduction.aspx"" shape=""rect"">common cold</a>. </p>
<p>Read more about <a href=""/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/flu-vaccine-side-effects.aspx"">flu jab side effects</a>.</p>
<h2>Who shouldn’t have the flu jab?</h2>
<p>You shouldn't have the flu vaccination if:</p>
<ul>
    <li>you've had a serious reaction to a flu vaccination before </li>
    <li>you have a high temperature (postpone it until you're better) </li>
</ul>
<p>Not all flu vaccines are suitable for children, so discuss this with your GP beforehand.</p>
<p>Speak to your GP, practice nurse or pharmacist if you have any further questions.</p>

<p>Below are some commonly asked questions about care and support.</p>
<h2>What are care and support services?</h2>
<p>Care and support services, also known as social care services, help people who are in need of practical support due to illness, disability, old age or a low income. </p>
<p>Care and support services could include having a personal assistant to help you around the home, structural changes to help you move around or manage in your house, or even an alarm system so that you can call for help if you have a fall.</p>
<p>Social care services are available to everyone, regardless of their background.</p>
<p>However, social care is subject to rules about your needs and ability. Services can also support the families or carers of people who receive social care. Find out more about your <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/Care-Act-2014-overview.aspx"" shape=""rect"">rights and entitlements to social care</a>.</p>
<h2>How are care and support services funded?</h2>
<p>Local authorities (councils) are responsible for providing social care services for those who need them and are eligible for them. After assessing your needs and finances, the local authority may agree to pay for some or all of the care and support you need. These council-funded social care services may be provided by ‘independent providers’ – firms or charities that specialise in providing social care services. Find out more about <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/funding-care.aspx"" shape=""rect"">funding care services</a>.</p>
<p>Even though most people have to fund all or part of their own care and support, local authorities have a duty to assess everyone’s care and support needs, and advise you on relevant local services.</p>
<p>Social care services can take many forms – you can get help from them while you live at home, out and about in the community, or even in a new place of residence such as a care home. To find out more, read <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/choosing-care-services.aspx"" shape=""rect"">choosing care</a> and <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/how-can-i-get-social-care-support.aspx"" shape=""rect"">arranging care</a>.</p>
<h2>How can social care help disabled people?</h2>
<p>Social care services can help and support people with disabilities to live more independently. Even if you are not eligible for free social care, you may still have a right to receive benefits and other financial help or access to equipment and concessions on transport or the Blue Badge Parking Scheme.</p>
<p>Details on these, together with information on disability rights under the <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/Equality-Act-disability-discrimination.aspx"" shape=""rect"">Equality Act</a> and in the <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/disability-in-the-workplace.aspx"" shape=""rect"">workplace</a>, can be found in this guide and on <a shape=""rect"" href=""https://www.gov.uk/browse/disabilities"" title=""External website"" shape=""rect"">GOV.UK</a>.</p>
<p>Read more about <a shape=""rect"" href=""/LiveWell/Disability"" shape=""rect"">living with a disability</a> with help from social care services.</p>
<h2>How can social care help older people?</h2>
<p>Most local authorities will have a social care team devoted to older people. These teams can <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/equipment-aids-adaptations.aspx"" shape=""rect"">provide support</a> that enables older people to remain living independently in their own home.</p>
<p>The local authority's team for older people will also be able to guide you through the options available if you are no longer able to live at home independently, for instance in sheltered accommodation, extra care housing, or <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/care-homes.aspx"" shape=""rect"">care and nursing homes</a>.</p>
<h2>I look after someone. Can social care help me?</h2>
<p>If you are looking after an ill, disabled or frail elderly relative or friend, you should recognise yourself as a carer. Carers can get a <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/carers-assessment.aspx"" shape=""rect"">range of support</a> from social care, and can be vital for helping arrange social care support for the person they care for. There are charities that support particular groups of carers, including sibling carers and <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/who-can-help-young-carers.aspx"" shape=""rect"">young carers</a>. </p>
<p>If you want to talk to someone about how to get support as a carer, call the Carers Direct helpline on 0300 123 1053.</p>
<h2>How can social care help my child?</h2>
<p>If you're worried about your child's general development or wellbeing and you think they need additional support, you should speak to your child’s GP or teacher first.</p>
<p>If you or your child need more significant support, contact the children’s services team in your local authority for a <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/assessment-care-needs.aspx"" shape=""rect"">needs assessment</a>.</p>
<p>This assessment of your child’s needs will be used to determine if they need more specialised support, including any <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Livewell/Childrenwithalearningdisability/Pages/Education.aspx"" shape=""rect"">special educational needs</a> your child may have. You should be involved in any decisions about your child, including what help will be provided to meet their needs.</p>
<p>This guide also provides <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/caring-for-a-disabled-child-tips.aspx"" shape=""rect"">tips for caring for a disabled child</a> and links to further help.</p>
<h3>Council help for children</h3>
<p>Each local authority will have people dealing specifically with social care for children. Use the GOV.UK website to <a shape=""rect"" href=""https://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-council"" shape=""rect"">find your local council</a> and get advice about an assessment for children’s services.</p>
<h2>How good are my local authority social services?</h2>
<p>If you are receiving care, looking after someone who receives care, or just planning for your future care, it’s worth finding out how well your local authority’s social care services are performing.</p>
<p>You can check how care services in your area are performing against measures in the <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Service-Search/performance/Results?ResultsViewId=1004"" shape=""rect"">Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework (ASCOF)</a>.</p>
<p>This will let you find out how carers and people receiving local authority funded care and support in your area rate:</p>
<ul>
    <li>their quality of life  </li>
    <li>their satisfaction with care services  </li>
    <li>feeling safe </li>
</ul>
<p>Alongside these are the levels of social services that the local authority offers, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the number of people receiving direct payments  </li>
    <li>the number of permanent admissions to care homes </li>
    <li>delayed transfers of care from hospitals </li>
</ul>
<p>You can also compare these with national and regional averages, to see whether your local authority is doing well, or could be performing better.</p>

This assessment will help you decide on the type of services you may want, as well as helping the local authority understand which services you need.</p>
<p>Your local authority may be able to offer you some care services for free. It’s worth finding out if you can get free services from your local authority because the cost of buying care services is likely to be high if you have long-term care needs, and they could increase as you get older. For more information, read about <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/funding-care.aspx"">funding your care</a>.</p>
<h2>How to get social services from your local authority</h2>
<p>Local authorities have a duty to assess anyone who appears to have care and support needs. Your local authority should:</p>
<ul>
    <li>assess your needs and give you advice, whatever your financial circumstances </li>
    <li>provide information about services and support options available to you in your area </li>
    <li>give you a carer’s assessment if you are an unpaid/family carer </li>
</ul>
<p>The assessment by the local authority is important because it helps them work out what your difficulties are and what services will help you most. For more information, read <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/what-social-care-services-are-available.aspx"">What social care services are available?</a></p>
<h3>Next steps after a care needs assessment</h3>
<p>If your local authority decides you are eligible for social care support, they will carry out a financial assessment to determine how much you will need to pay towards your care, if anything. After this, if you are eligible for care and support, social services or an independent adviser will work with you to create a <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/care-plans.aspx"">care and support plan</a>.</p>
<p>Often, only minor assistance is needed – such as <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/meals-nutrition-feeding.aspx"">meals on wheels</a> and help with washing or dressing, yet these services could make a big difference to your life.</p>
<p>If you feel that your needs have changed over time, you can request a review of your care plan, or a re-assessment if you were not originally eligible for care and support. Contact the social care team at <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-council"">your local authority</a> to discuss this.</p>
<h2>Your social care rights and entitlements</h2>
<p>Under UK law, you should be looked after and treated fairly and with dignity whenever you are given social care services. This applies to everyone, regardless of where they are given care and who does the caring. This comes under the <a href=""http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/contents"">UK Human Rights Act</a>.</p>
<p>Several rights may apply because of this law, including the right to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>life </li>
    <li>liberty </li>
    <li>respect for private and family life, home and correspondence </li>
    <li>not be treated in an inhuman or degrading way </li>
</ul>
<p>Other laws may also protect you from discrimination because of who you are, including some protection for carers under the rules designed to protect disabled people. For example, if you are an older person, this should not stop you from having treatment similar to that which a younger person would be given.</p>
<p>In most cases, you shouldn’t have to actively exert your rights about the care you receive. However, if you feel you are being unjustly treated in breach of your rights, you may want to take action. You can do this by telling someone you trust, seeking help from an <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/advocacy-services.aspx"">advocacy service</a>, or contacting the local authority team in charge of &quot;safeguarding&quot;. Find out about safeguarding on the <a href=""http://www.cqc.org.uk/content/safeguarding-people"">Care Quality Commission website</a>.</p>
<p>Find out how the <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/Equality-Act-disability-discrimination.aspx"">Equality Act</a> and the <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/mental-capacity.aspx"">Mental Capacity Act</a> protect your rights to be treated fairly, and make your own decisions wherever possible.</p>
<h2>When things go wrong with social care</h2>
<p>At times, things may go wrong with your care. You may find that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>you disagree with a decision about your care </li>
    <li>you disagree with the outcome of an assessment </li>
    <li>you believe standards or quality of care have been poor </li>
    <li>you believe the amount of care you have got has not been enough </li>
    <li>you believe the costs of care are unfair </li>
    <li>you feel that staff have behaved badly or inappropriately </li>
</ul>
<p>However, you should be actively involved in the care and support process <span style=""white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;text-transform:none;float:none;color:rgb(88,88,88);font:13px/18px arial, helvetica, sans-serif;display:inline !important;letter-spacing:normal;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);text-indent:0px"">–</span> for example, during the assessment and in developing the care and support plan. The council must attempt to reasonably agree any course of action with you and anyone else you request. You should make the council aware of anything that you are not happy with during these discussions.</p>
<h3>Give feedback on care services</h3>
<p>If you have been using homecare services, a care home or a nursing home, you can <a href=""/Service-Search/Care-homes-and-care-at-home/LocationSearch/11"">leave good or negative feedback on their services</a>. These comments will be publicly available on the service’s online profile and they will be asked to publicly respond to the comments.</p>
<p>However, if that doesn’t get a result, you may wish to make a formal complaint. Whoever is providing your care services will, by law, have a complaints procedure available. This should be your first step in trying to address what has gone wrong. Friends and relatives may be able to help you with a complaint, as can the <a href=""http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/"">Citizen’s Advice Bureau</a> and many other charities.</p>
<p>If you have been <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/vulnerable-people-abuse-safeguarding.aspx"">seriously abused</a>, you should call the police. You may want to speak with the &quot;safeguarding&quot; team at your local authority. </p>
<p>If your complaint is about a private or voluntary care provider, contact the <a href=""http://www.cqc.org.uk/"">Care Quality Commission</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>Choosing your care services can be a daunting prospect. There are many care options available, but which kind of support is right for you?</p>
<p>Think about what you get most out of in life. You may have particular interests that you want to keep up, or you may simply want to spend time with your family or friends. You may have a job that you want to keep on doing, or a social activity, sport, religion or a political group that you want to keep up with.</p>
<p>Your social care support should – as much as possible – help you to continue to do these things, and may help you find new things to do. When choosing the type of care, you also need to think about:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href=""#location"">location</a> </li>
    <li><a href=""#services"">services</a> </li>
    <li><a href=""#standards"">standards and quality</a> </li>
    <li><a href=""#price"">price</a> </li>
</ul>
<h2><span id=""location"">Location</span> of your care</h2>
<p>Your own home is often the best place for you to get care services. At home is where you may have family and friends and you’ll be in a familiar and hopefully safe environment.</p>
<p>You may want to get help at home, perhaps through having home help come in to help you with daily tasks. To stay independently at home, you may need to have care services in the form of adaptations to your home (to help with mobility, for example) or perhaps just equipment to help you out.</p>
<p>However, your home may not always be the best environment if you have care needs. It may not be safe for you, particularly if you do not have a friend or relative around to help (if you live in an isolated rural area, for example). Or you may have particular needs that cannot be easily met in your home.</p>
<p>If you do need to move out of your home for care reasons, there is a variety of accommodation options that you may want to consider. These include sheltered housing, extra care housing and residential care homes or nursing homes.</p>
<p>If you are thinking about moving, it's worth considering whether it is best to stay in the area you are in now, which you will be familiar with, or whether you should move elsewhere to be nearer family or friends. You may also want to think about the location from a practical perspective (whether it's on a bus route, for example) or for more personal reasons (such as whether you like the surroundings).</p>
<h2><span id=""services"">The</span> kinds of care services on offer </h2>
<p>If you are choosing a care service – particularly if it's an ongoing service such as home care or a place in a care home, you should think about the particular things you want from the service (this will often be referred to as your &quot;outcomes&quot;).</p>
<p>Use the services search to find out about the location, services, facilities, staff and performance of a Care Quality Commission (CQC) registered <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/care-homes.aspx"">care home</a> or <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/home-care.aspx"">homecare provider</a>. Your search results should tell you whether a service can support you if you have particular needs, such as a sensory impairment or a learning disability.</p>
<p>If the service is not registered with the CQC, you may have to ask them directly for information about the services, and you may want to get independent verification, if any is available. Your local authority may have a list of local support providers, with information on each.</p>
<h2><span id=""standards"">Standards</span> and quality of care </h2>
<p>Everyone has a right to expect certain standards in their care. Your care services should help keep you safe and well, but also treat you with dignity and respect. You should always be able to express a choice in your care. </p>
<p>The standards for social care providers, such as care homes, are set out by the CQC. The CQC's inspection reports will tell you which services are meeting the minimum requirements. If you do not think the service is meeting these requirements, you may want to <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/how-to-make-a-complaint.aspx"">make a complaint</a>.</p>
<p>Good quality services, in whatever form they take, will treat you as an individual and attend to your personal needs. If you have homecare, for instance, the care workers who come into your home should listen to your wishes and include you and your family in decisions and care.</p>
<p>When choosing care, you might want to look out for services that are signed up to the <a href=""https://www.thesocialcarecommitment.org.uk/Home/About"">social care commitment</a>. </p>
<p>Check how well <a href=""/Service-Search/performance/Results?ResultsViewId=1004"">your local authority social services</a> are performing.</p>
<h2><span id=""price"">The</span> price of your care</h2>
<p>When choosing social care services, you will have to consider how much the services may cost. The cost of your care may reflect each of the aspects listed above: location, quality and the kinds of services offered.</p>
<p>If you have had an assessment from your local authority, you may get services for free. However, many people have to pay for their own care services (self-funders), and even people who have care funded by the local authority will need to know about the costs of care if they are using a personal budget or a direct payment.

                        <p>If you have care and support needs and find it difficult to look after yourself, your local authority may be able advise you and provide you with some help. </p>
<p>The best way to get help from your local authority is to ask for a care and support needs assessment. You can do this by contacting the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/help-care-support"">local authority adult social services department</a>.</p>
<p>When you get assessed by the local authority, as a minimum you may be given information and signposting to other services, and ways that you might find funding to pay for them. However, if your needs meet the <a href=""#eligibility"">national eligibility criteria</a>, your local authority will have to meet these needs. </p>
<div class=""imagedivright-2col"">
<div class=""image""><img alt="""" style=""border-top:0px solid;border-right:0px solid;border-bottom:0px solid;border-left:0px solid"" src=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/PublishingImages/CARE%20AND%20SUPPORT/HOW%20TO%20GET%20CARE%20SERVICES/care-needs-assessment_364x200_SOCA1165-9553.jpg""></div>
</div>
<p>The local authority will involve you throughout the assessment to identify what your needs are and how these impact on your wellbeing. They will also discuss with you how you wish to live your life and whether there are certain aims you would like to achieve but you are unable to do so because of your care and support needs. </p>
<p>The assessment will start to consider how your care needs might be met. This could include identifying how preventative services like simple aids (such as devices to open jars and tins more easily), adaptations to your home (such as handrails) or information about support available in the community might meet your need.  It will also identify if you have a higher level of need where you may need <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/home-care.aspx"">help in your own home</a> or care in a <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/care-homes.aspx"">care home</a>.</p>
<p>The assessment should be carried out in a way that ensures your involvement and that takes the right amount of time to capture all of your needs. </p>
<p>If you have a friend or family member looking after you as an unpaid carer, they can have a <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/carers-assessment.aspx"">carer’s assessment</a> to see if they need support to carry on their caring role.</p>
<p>The local authority must give you a copy of your needs assessment or carer’s assessment.</p>
<h2><span id=""eligibility"">What</span> are the national eligibility criteria for care and support?</h2>
<p>The eligibility threshold for adults with care and support needs is based on identifying how a person’s needs affect their ability to achieve relevant outcomes, and how this impacts on their wellbeing.</p>
<p>Local authorities must consider whether the person’s needs: </p>
<ul>
    <li>arise from or are related to a physical or mental impairment or illness </li>
    <li>make them unable to achieve two or more specified outcomes </li>
    <li>as a result of being unable to meet these outcomes, there is likely to be a significant impact on the adult’s wellbeing </li>
</ul>
<p>An adult’s needs are only eligible where they meet all three of these conditions.</p>
<p>The specified outcomes measured include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>managing and maintaining nutrition, such as being able to prepare and eat food and drink </li>
    <li>maintaining personal hygiene, such as being able to wash themselves and their clothes </li>
    <li>managing toilet needs </li>
    <li>being able to dress appropriately, for example during cold weather </li>
    <li>being able to move around the home safely, including accessing the home from outside </li>
    <li>keeping the home sufficiently clean and safe </li>
    <li>being able to develop and maintain family or other personal relationships, in order to avoid loneliness or isolation </li>
    <li>accessing and engaging in work, training, education or volunteering, including physical access </li>
    <li>being able to safely use necessary facilities or services in the local community including public transport and recreational facilities or services </li>
    <li>carrying out any caring responsibilities, such as for a child </li>
</ul>
<p>Local authorities do not have responsibility for providing NHS services such as patient transport, but they should consider needs for support when the adult is attending healthcare appointments.</p>
<h2>Local authorities' duty to carry out a needs assessment</h2>
<p>Local authorities have a duty to assess a person who appears to need care and support. They may need care and support because of serious illness, physical disability, learning disability, mental health problems or frailty because of old age.</p>
<p>The local authority is obliged to carry out a needs assessment when they become aware that someone may be in need of care and support. </p>
<p>This may mean that an assessment is offered even if have not specifically requested one. Alternatively, you can contact your local social services department and ask them to arrange a needs assessment.</p>
<p>Normally, an assessment is carried out before a service can be provided by the social services department of a local authority. If you need care urgently, the local authority may be able to meet these needs without carrying out the assessment.</p>
<h2>Local authorities' duty to carry out a carer’s assessment</h2>
<p>Local authorities have a duty to carry out a carer’s assessment where a carer appears to need support.</p>
<p>The carer’s assessment will consider the carer’s need for support and whether the can continue to care without help.<br>
The assessment can be offered even if the carer has not asked for one.</p>
<h2>Needs assessments and local authority funding</h2>
<p>Once a local authority has established that a person has needs that meet the national eligibility criteria, it has to make sure that these needs are met. The first step will be to draw up and <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/care-plans.aspx"">care and support plan</a>, or in the case of a carer with eligible needs, a support plan.</p>
<p>If you have eligible needs, the local authority will check that you normally live in their area. Social care is not free and you may have to contribute towards the cost of meeting your needs. Local authorities will do an assessment to see if you have to contribute and how much that would be.</p>
<p>The local authority should not refuse to meet eligible needs on the grounds of cost, although if there is more than one option, it is allowed to choose what it believes is the most cost effective one.</p>
<p>If your needs do not meet the national eligibility criteria, the local authority still has to give you information and advice on what support might be available in the community to support you.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may want to consider <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/funding-your-own-care-self-funder.aspx"">funding your own care and support</a> to help with the needs identified as a result of the assessment.</p>
<p>If you disagree with your needs assessment or the care and support plan, there are ways that decisions can be challenged or you can <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/how-to-make-a-complaint.aspx"">make a complaint</a>.</p>

<h2>Where can NHS continuing healthcare be provided?<span id=""can""></span></h2>
<p>NHS continuing healthcare can be provided in a variety of settings outside hospital, such as in your home or in a registered care home. </p>
<h2>Eligibility for NHS continuing healthcare<span id=""eligibility""></span></h2>
<p>NHS continuing healthcare is for adults. Children and young people may receive a 'continuing care package' if they have needs arising from disability, accident or illness that can't be met by existing universal or specialist services alone. Find out more about <a href=""/CarersDirect/guide/practicalsupport/Documents/National-framework-for-continuing-care-england.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens in new window"">continuing care for children and young people (PDF, 560kb)</a>. </p>
<p>To be eligible for NHS continuing healthcare, you must be assessed by a team of healthcare professionals (a &quot;multi-disciplinary team&quot;) as having a &quot;primary health need&quot;. Whether or not someone has a primary health need is assessed by looking at all their care needs and relating them to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>what help is needed </li>
    <li>how complex these needs are </li>
    <li>how intense or severe these needs can be </li>
    <li>how unpredictable they are, including any risks to the person's health if the right care isn't provided at the right time </li>
</ul>
<p>Your eligibility for NHS continuing healthcare depends on your assessed needs, and not on any particular diagnosis or condition. If your needs change then your eligibility for NHS continuing healthcare may change.</p>
<p>You should be fully involved in the assessment process and kept informed, and have your views about your needs and support taken into account. Carers and family members should also be consulted where appropriate.</p>
<p>A decision about eligibility should usually be made within 28 days of it being decided that the person needs a full assessment for NHS continuing healthcare.</p>
<p>If you aren't eligible for NHS continuing healthcare, you can be referred to your local authority who can discuss with you whether you may be eligible for support from them. If you still have some health needs then the NHS may still pay for part of the package of support. This is sometimes known as a &quot;joint package&quot; of care.</p>
<h2>NHS continuing healthcare assessments<span id=""assessments""></span></h2>
<p>Clinical commissioning groups, known as CCGs (the NHS organisations that commission local health services), must assess you for NHS continuing healthcare if it seems that you may need it. </p>
<p>For most people, there is an initial checklist assessment, which is used to decide if you need a full assessment. However, if you need care urgently <span style=""white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;text-transform:none;float:none;font:13px/18px arial,helvetica,sans-serif;display:inline ! important;letter-spacing:normal;background-color:#ffffff;text-indent:0px;color:#585858"">– </span>for example, if you’re terminally ill <span style=""white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;text-transform:none;float:none;font:13px/18px arial,helvetica,sans-serif;display:inline ! important;letter-spacing:normal;background-color:#ffffff;text-indent:0px;color:#585858"">– </span>your assessment may be fast-tracked.</p>
<h3>Initial assessment for NHS continuing healthcare</h3>
<p>The initial checklist assessment can be completed by a nurse, doctor, other healthcare professional or social worker. You should be told that you’re being assessed, and be asked for your consent.</p>
<p>Depending on the outcome of the checklist, you will either be told that you don't meet the criteria for a full assessment of NHS continuing healthcare and are therefore not eligible, or you will be referred for a full assessment of eligibility. Being referred for a full assessment doesn’t necessarily mean that you will be eligible for NHS continuing healthcare. The purpose of the checklist is to enable anyone who might be eligible to have the opportunity for a full assessment.</p>
<p>The professional(s) completing the checklist should record written reasons for their decision, and sign and date the checklist. You should be given a copy of the completed checklist. You can download a blank copy of the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/213138/NHS-CHC-Checklist-FINAL.pdf"" title=""Opens in new window"" target=""_blank"">NHS continuing healthcare checklist from GOV.UK (PDF, 168kb)</a>.</p>
<h3>Full assessment for NHS continuing healthcare</h3>
<p>Full assessments for NHS continuing healthcare are undertaken by a &quot;multi-disciplinary&quot; team made up of a minimum of two health or care professionals who are already involved in your care. You should be informed who is co-ordinating the NHS continuing healthcare assessment.</p>
<p>The team’s assessment will consider your needs under the following headings:</p>
<ul>
    <li>behaviour </li>
    <li>cognition (understanding) </li>
    <li>communication </li>
    <li>psychological/emotional needs </li>
    <li>mobility </li>
    <li>nutrition (food and drink) </li>
    <li>continence </li>
    <li>skin (including wounds and ulcers) </li>
    <li>breathing </li>
    <li>symptom control through drug therapies and medication </li>
    <li>altered states of consciousness </li>
    <li>other significant needs </li>
</ul>
<p>These needs are then given a weighting marked &quot;priority&quot;, &quot;severe&quot;, &quot;high&quot;, &quot;moderate&quot;, &quot;low&quot; or &quot;no needs&quot;.</p>
<p>The multi-disciplinary team will consider:</p>
<ul>
    <li>what help is needed </li>
    <li>how complex these needs are </li>
    <li>how intense or severe these needs can be </li>
    <li>how unpredictable they are, including any risks to the person's health if the right care isn't provided at the right time </li>
</ul>
<p>If you have at least one priority need, or severe needs in at least two areas, you should be eligible for NHS continuing healthcare. You may also be eligible if you have a severe need in one area plus a number of other needs, or a number of high or moderate needs, depending on their nature, intensity, complexity or unpredictability.</p>
<p>In all cases, the overall need, and interactions between needs, will be taken into account, together with evidence from risk assessments, in deciding whether NHS continuing healthcare should be provided.</p>
<p>The assessment should take into account your views and the views of any carers you have. You should be given a copy of the decision documents, along with clear reasons for the decision.</p>
<p>You can <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-framework-for-nhs-continuing-healthcare-and-nhs-funded-nursing-care"">download a blank copy of the NHS continuing healthcare decision support tool from GOV.UK</a>.</p>
<h3>Fast-track assessment for NHS continuing healthcare</h3>
<p>If someone’s condition is deteriorating quickly and they are nearing the end of their life, they should be considered for the NHS continuing healthcare fast track pathway, so that an appropriate care and support package can be put in place as soon as possible – usually within 48 hours.</p>
<h2>Care and support planning<span id=""planning""></span></h2>
<p>If you are eligible for NHS continuing healthcare, the next stage is to arrange a care and support package which meets your assessed needs.</p>
<p>Depending on your situation, different options could be suitable, including support in your own home and the option of a <a href=""/choiceintheNHS/Yourchoices/personal-health-budgets/Pages/about-personal-health-budgets.aspx"">personal health budget</a>. If it is agreed that a care home is the best option for you, there could be more than one local care home that is suitable.</p>
<p>Your CCG should work collaboratively with you and consider your views when agreeing your care and support package and the setting where it will be provided. However, they can also take other factors, such as the cost and value for money of different options, into account. </p>
<h2>NHS continuing healthcare reviews<span id=""reviews""></span></h2>
<p>If you are eligible for NHS continuing healthcare, your needs and support package should normally be reviewed within three months and thereafter at least annually. This review will consider whether your existing care and support package meets your assessed needs. If your needs have changed, the review will also consider whether you are still eligible for NHS continuing healthcare.</p>
<h2>Refunds for delays in NHS continuing healthcare funding<span id=""refunds""></span></h2>
<p>CCGs should normally make a decision about eligibility for NHS continuing healthcare within 28 days of getting a completed checklist or request for a full assessment, unless there are circumstances beyond its control.</p>
<p>If the CCG decides that you are eligible, but takes longer than 28 days to decide this, and the delay is unjustifiable, they should refund any care costs from the 29th day until the date of their decision.</p>
<p>If your CCG decided that you weren’t eligible for NHS continuing healthcare, but then revised this decision after a dispute, it should refund your care costs for the period between their original decision and their revised decision.</p>
<h2>If you are not eligible for NHS continuing healthcare<span id=""ineligible""></span><span id=""ineligible""></span></h2>
<p>If you are not eligible for NHS continuing healthcare, but you are assessed as requiring nursing care in a care home (in other words, a care home that is registered to provide nursing care) you will be eligible for NHS-funded nursing care. This means that the NHS will pay a contribution towards the cost of your registered nursing care. This is known as NHS-funding nursing care and is available irrespective of who is funding the rest of the care home fees.</p>

<h2>Frequently asked questions about NHS continuing healthcare<span id=""faq""></span></h2>
<h3>I have a local authority support package that works well. I am now eligible for NHS continuing healthcare <span style=""white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;text-transform:none;float:none;font:13px/18px arial,helvetica,sans-serif;display:inline ! important;letter-spacing:normal;background-color:#ffffff;text-indent:0px;color:#585858"">–</span> will my support package change?</h3>
<p>If you are concerned about changes to your care package because of a move to NHS continuing healthcare, your CCG should talk to you about ways that it can give you as much choice and control as possible. This could include the use of a personal health budget, with one option being a 'direct payment for healthcare'. </p>
<p>Find out about <a href=""/choiceintheNHS/Yourchoices/personal-health-budgets/Pages/about-personal-health-budgets.aspx"">choice in the NHS and personal health budgets</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re still not satisfied, you may want to complain.</p>
<h3>Can someone refuse an assessment for NHS continuing healthcare? If they do refuse, will they be able to get services from their local authority?</h3>
<p>An assessment for NHS continuing healthcare can’t be carried out without someone’s consent, so it is possible to refuse. However, if they do refuse, although they will still be entitled to an assessment by the local authority there is no guarantee that they will be provided with services. This is because there is a legal limit on the type of services that a local authority can provide.</p>
<p>If you refuse to be assessed for NHS continuing healthcare,<span style=""white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;text-transform:none;float:none;font:13px/18px arial,helvetica,sans-serif;display:inline ! important;letter-spacing:normal;background-color:#ffffff;text-indent:0px;color:#585858""> </span>the CCG should explore your reasons for refusing, and try to address your concerns. If someone lacks the mental capacity to consent to or refuse an assessment, the principles of the <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/mental-capacity.aspx"">Mental Capacity Act </a>will apply and in most circumstances an assessment will be provided in the person's best interest. </p>
<h3>My relative is in a care home and has become eligible for NHS continuing healthcare. The CCG says the fees charged by this care home are more than they would usually pay, and has proposed a move to a different care home. I think a move will have a negative effect on my relative. What can we do?</h3>
<p>If there is evidence that a move is likely to have a significantly detrimental effect on your relative's health or wellbeing, you should discuss this with the CCG who will take your concerns into account when considering the most appropriate arrangements.</p>
<p>If the CCG decides to arrange an alternative placement, they should make efforts to provide a reasonable choice of homes. </p>
<h3>Is it possible to pay top-up fees for NHS continuing healthcare?</h3>
<p>No, it is not possible to top up NHS continuing healthcare packages, like you can with local authority care packages.</p>
<p>The only way that NHS continuing healthcare packages can be topped up privately is if you pay for additional private services on top of the services you get from the NHS. These private services should be provided by different staff and preferably in a different setting.</p>

<div class=""image""><img alt="""" src=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/PublishingImages/MONEY%20RIGHTS%20LEGAL/RIGHTS/mental-capacity_364x200_88622102.jpg""></div>
</div>
<p>The Mental Capacity Act (MCA) is designed to protect and empower individuals who may lack the mental capacity to make their own decisions about their care and treatment. It is a law that applies to individuals aged 16 and over. </p>
<p>Examples of people who may lack capacity include those with: </p>
<ul>
    <li><a href=""/conditions/dementia-guide/pages/about-dementia.aspx"">dementia</a> </li>
    <li>a severe <a href=""/livewell/childrenwithalearningdisability/pages/whatislearningdisability.aspx"">learning disability</a> </li>
    <li>a <a href=""/conditions/head-injury-severe-/pages/introduction.aspx"">brain injury</a> </li>
    <li>a <a href=""/conditions/mental-health/pages/introduction.aspx"">mental health condition</a> </li>
    <li>a <a href=""/conditions/stroke/pages/introduction.aspx"">stroke</a> </li>
    <li>unconsciousness caused by an anaesthetic or sudden accident </li>
</ul>
<p>However, just because a person has one of these conditions does not necessarily mean they lack the capacity to make a specific decision. </p>
<p>Someone can lack capacity to make some decisions (for example, to decide on complex financial issues) but still have the capacity to make other decisions (for example, to decide what items to buy at the local shop). </p>
<p>The MCA says:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Everyone has the right to make his or her own decisions. Health and care professionals should always assume an individual has the capacity to make a decision themselves, unless it is proved otherwise through a capacity assessment. </li>
    <li>Individuals must be given help to make a decision themselves. This might include, for example, providing the person with information in a format that is easier for them to understand. </li>
    <li>Just because someone makes what those caring for them consider to be an &quot;unwise&quot; decision, they should not be treated as lacking the capacity to make that decision. Everyone has the right to make their own life choices, where they have the capacity to do so. </li>
    <li>Where someone is judged not to have the capacity to make a specific decision (following a capacity assessment), that decision can be taken for them, but it must be in their best interests. </li>
    <li>Treatment and care provided to someone who lacks capacity should be the least restrictive of their basic rights and freedoms possible, while still providing the required treatment and care. </li>
</ul>
<p>The MCA also allows people to express their preferences for care and treatment in case they lack capacity to make these decisions. It also allows them to appoint a trusted person to make a decision on their behalf should they lack capacity in the future. </p>
<p>People should also be provided with an <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/advocacy-services.aspx"">independent advocate</a> who will support them to make decisions in certain situations, such as serious treatment or where the individual might have significant restrictions placed on their freedom and rights in their best interests.</p>

</ul>
<h2><span id=""mentalcapacity"">How</span> 'mental capacity' is determined</h2>
<p>The MCA sets out a two-stage test of capacity.</p>
<p>1) Does the individual concerned have an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, their mind or brain, whether as a result of a condition, illness, or external factors such as alcohol or drug use? </p>
<p>2) Does the impairment or disturbance mean the individual is unable to make a specific decision when they need to? Individuals can lack capacity to make some decisions but have capacity to make others, so it is vital to consider whether the individual lacks capacity to make the specific decision. </p>
<p>Also, capacity can fluctuate with time – an individual may lack capacity at one point in time, but may be able to make the same decision at a later point in time. Where appropriate, individuals should be allowed the time to make a decision themselves. </p>
<p>In relation to the second question, the MCA says a person is unable to make a decision if they cannot:</p>
<ul>
    <li>understand the information relevant to the decision </li>
    <li>retain that information </li>
    <li>use or weigh up that information as part of the process of making the decision </li>
</ul>
<p>If they aren't able to do any of the above three things or communicate their decision (by talking, using sign language, or through any other means), the MCA says they will be treated as unable to make the specific decision in question. </p>
<h2><span id=""decisionmaking"">Mental capacity and supporting</span> decision-making</h2>
<p>Before deciding an individual lacks capacity to make a particular decision, appropriate steps must be taken to enable them to make the decision themselves. </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Does the individual have all the relevant information they need? </li>
    <li>Have they been given information on any alternatives? </li>
    <li>Could information be explained or presented in a way that is easier to understand (for example, by using simple language or visual aids)? </li>
    <li>Have different methods of communication been explored, such as non-verbal communication? </li>
    <li>Could anyone else help with communication, such as a family member, carer, or advocate? </li>
    <li>Are there particular times of day when the individual's understanding is better? </li>
    <li>Are there particular locations where the individual may feel more at ease? </li>
    <li>Could the decision be delayed until a time when the individual might be better able to make the decision? </li>
</ul>
<h2><span id=""bestinterests"">Making</span> best interests decisions for someone</h2>
<p>If someone is found to lack the capacity to make a decision and such a decision needs to be made for them, the MCA states the decision must be made in their best interests.</p>
<p>The MCA sets out a checklist of things to consider when deciding what's in an individual's best interests. It says you should:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Encourage participation – do whatever is possible to permit or encourage the individual to take part. </li>
    <li>Identify all relevant circumstances – try to identify the things the individual lacking capacity would take into account if they were making the decision themselves. </li>
    <li>Find out the individual's views – including their past and present wishes and feelings, and any beliefs or values. </li>
    <li>Avoid discrimination – do not make assumptions on the basis of age, appearance, condition or behaviour. </li>
    <li>Assess whether the individual might regain capacity – if they might, could the decision be postponed? </li>
</ul>
<p>Consulting with others is a vital part of best interest decision-making. People who should be consulted include anyone previously named by the person concerned, anyone engaged in caring for them, close relatives, friends or others who take an interest in their welfare, any attorney appointed under a <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/lasting-power-of-attorney.aspx"">Lasting Power of Attorney</a> or Enduring Power of Attorney, and any deputy appointed by the Court of Protection to make decisions for the person. </p>
<h2><span id=""alternatives"">Finding</span> alternatives to making a decision on someone else's behalf</h2>
<p>Before somebody makes a decision or acts on behalf of a person who lacks capacity to make a decision or to consent to an act, they must always question if they can do something else that would interfere less with the person's basic rights and freedoms. </p>
<p>This is called finding the &quot;least restrictive alternative&quot;. It includes considering whether there is a need to act or make a decision at all.</p>
<p>Where there is more than one option, it is important to explore ways that would be less restrictive or allow the most freedom for a person who lacks capacity. </p>
<p>However, the final decision must always allow the original purpose of the decision or act to be achieved. </p>
<p>Any decision or action must still be in the best interests of the person who lacks capacity. So sometimes it may be necessary to choose an option that is not the least restrictive alternative if that option is in the person's best interests. </p>
<h3>Deprivation of liberty</h3>
<p>In certain cases, the restrictions placed upon an individual who lacks capacity to consent to the arrangements of their care may amount to &quot;deprivation of liberty&quot;. This must be judged on a case-by-case basis. </p>
<p>Where it appears a deprivation of liberty might occur, the provider of care (usually a hospital or a care home) has to apply to their local authority, who will then arrange an assessment of the individual's care and treatment to decide if the deprivation of liberty is in the best interests of the individual concerned. </p>
<p>If it is, the local authority will grant a legal authorisation. If it is not, the care and treatment package must be changed – otherwise, an unlawful deprivation of liberty will occur. This system is known as the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards. </p>
<p>If you suspect a deprivation of liberty may occur, the first step should be to talk to the care provider and then possibly the local authority.</p>
<h2><span id=""advance"">Advance</span> statements and decisions</h2>
<p>An advance statement is a written statement that sets down a person's preferences, wishes, beliefs and values regarding their future care. It is not legally binding.</p>
<p>The aim is to provide a guide for anyone who might have to make decisions in someone's best interests if they have lost the capacity to make decisions or communicate their decision.</p>
<p>An advance statement can cover any aspect of a person's future health or social care. This could include: </p>
<ul>
    <li>how they want any religious or spiritual beliefs they hold to be reflected in their care </li>
    <li>where they would like to be cared for – for example, at home or in a hospital, nursing home or hospice </li>
    <li>how they like to do things – for example, if they prefer a shower instead of a bath, or like to sleep with the light on </li>
    <li>concerns about practical issues – for example, who will look after their pet if they become ill </li>
</ul>

<p>An advance decision (sometimes known as an advance decision to refuse treatment, an ADRT, or a living will) is a legally binding decision that allows someone aged 18 or over, while still capable, to refuse specified medical treatment for a time in the future when they may lack capacity to consent to or refuse that treatment.</p>
<p>An advance decision must be valid and applicable to current circumstances. If it is, it has the same effect as a decision made by a person with capacity – healthcare professionals must follow the decision.</p>
<p>If the advance decision refuses life-sustaining treatment, it must:</p>
<ul>
    <li>be in writing, signed and witnessed  </li>
    <li>state clearly that the decision applies even if life is at risk </li>
</ul>
<p>People who make an advance decision may wish to consider letting their family, friends and carers know about it.</p>

<h2><span id=""LPA"">Lasting</span> Powers of Attorney (LPA)</h2>
<p>You can grant a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) to another person (or people) to enable them to make decisions about your health and welfare, or decisions about your property and financial affairs. Separate legal documents are made for each of these decisions, appointing one or more attorneys for each.</p>
<p>An Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA) under the previous law was restricted to making decisions over just property and financial affairs. An EPA made before the Mental Capacity Act came into force on October 1 2007 remains valid.</p>
<p>Powers of attorney can be made at any time when the person making it has the mental capacity to do so, provided they are 18 or over. Both an EPA and LPA must be registered. An LPA can be registered at any time, but a personal welfare LPA will only be effective once the person has lost the capacity to make their own decisions. </p>
<p>When acting under an LPA, an attorney must:</p>
<ul>
    <li>make sure the MCA's statutory principles are followed </li>
    <li>check whether the person has the capacity to make that particular decision for themselves – if they do, a personal welfare LPA cannot be used and the person must make the decision </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the Court of Protection will be able to appoint deputies who can also take decisions on health and welfare, as well as in financial matters, if the person concerned lacks the capacity to make a decision. </p>
<p>They will come into action when the court needs to delegate an ongoing series of decisions rather than one decision. If the person concerned already has an LPA appointed, they won't normally need a deputy as well.</p>
<p>The Office of the Public Guardian registers LPAs and EPAs and supervises court-appointed deputies. It provides evidence to the Court of Protection and information and guidance to the public. The Public Guardian works with a range of agencies, such as the financial sector, police and social services, to investigate concerns.</p>
<h2><span id=""COP"">The</span> Court of Protection</h2>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/court-of-protection"">Court of Protection</a> oversees the operation of the Mental Capacity Act and deals with all issues, including financial and serious healthcare matters, concerning people who lack the mental capacity to make their own decisions.</p>
<p>The court also tries to resolve all disputes when the person's carer, healthcare worker or social worker disagree about what's in the person's best interests, or when the views of the attorneys conflict in relation to property and welfare.</p>
<p>The court hears important cases, such as whether the NHS should withdraw treatment, whether a serious medical treatment decision is in a person's best interests, or whether it is in a person's best interests to be deprived of their liberty. Cases can be brought to the court by family members, as well as advocates and professionals involved in decisions.</p>
<h2><span id=""professional"">Professionals</span>' duties under the Mental Capacity Act</h2>
<p>The Mental Capacity Act applies to all professions – doctors, nurses, social workers, occupational therapists, health care assistants, and support staff. These staff and their employers have a duty to ensure they are trained in its implementation.</p>
<p>All staff working in the NHS and in social care are expected to have an understanding of the act as it relates to their own responsibilities. Most trusts and local authorities will have a Mental Capacity Act lead who provides specialist advice on the implementation.</p>

</div>
<p>If you need help around the home, a good option is to have a care worker come in to your home to help you.</p>
<h2>Types of homecare</h2>
<p>Homecare comes in many forms and has many names used to describe it, including home help, care attendants and &quot;carers&quot; (not to be confused with unpaid family or friends who care for you).</p>
<p>Homecare can suit you if you need:</p>
<ul>
    <li>personal care, such as washing or dressing </li>
    <li>housekeeping or domestic work, such as vacuuming </li>
    <li>cooking or preparing meals </li>
    <li>nursing and health care </li>
    <li>companionship </li>
</ul>
<p>Homecare can be very flexible, in order to meet your needs, and the same person or agency may be able to provide some or all of these options for the duration of your care:</p>
<ul>
    <li>long-term 24-hour care </li>
    <li>short breaks for an unpaid family carer </li>
    <li>emergency care  </li>
    <li>day care </li>
    <li>sessions ranging from 15-minute visits to 24-hour assistance and everything in between </li>
</ul>
<p>If you already know what you want, you can search NHS Choices directories for:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href=""/Service-Search/Care-at-home/LocationSearch/1833"">local homecare services and agencies</a> </li>
    <li>a list of <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/national-homecare-providers.aspx"">national homecare organisations</a> </li>
    <li>services that can help you stay safe and well in your home on a long-term basis; these services, often known as &quot;<a href=""/Service-Search/Supported-living-services/LocationSearch/1835"">supported living services</a>&quot;, can include financial, help with medication, advocacy, social and practical support </li>
    <li>a place to live in a family who will care for you, known as &quot;<a href=""/Service-Search/Shared-lives/LocationSearch/1834"">shared lives services</a>&quot; or adult placement services </li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe that you might benefit from some help at home, the first thing to do is to contact your social services department to ask for an assessment of your care and support needs. To contact social services, go to <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-council"">GOV.UK: find your local authority</a>.</p>
<p>If you are eligible for homecare services, the local authority may provide or arrange the help themselves. Alternatively, you can arrange your own care, funded by the local authority, through <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/direct-payments-personal-budgets.aspx"">direct payments or a personal budget</a>.</p>
<p>If you have chosen direct payments or a personal budget, or you aren’t eligible for local authority help and want to get care privately, you can arrange it in several different ways.</p>
<h2>Independent homecare agencies</h2>
<p>If you use an independent homecare agency, you or the person you're looking after has to find the care agency and pay them.</p>
<p>The agency will provide a service through a trained team of care workers, which means you may not always have the same person visiting your home, although the agency will do its best to take your choices into account. Independent homecare providers are regulated by the <a href=""/nhsengland/thenhs/healthregulators/pages/carequalitycommission.aspx"">Care Quality Commission (CQC)</a>. Homecare agencies must meet CQC’s national minimum standards and regulations in areas such as training and record-keeping. The CQC has the power to inspect agencies and enforce standards.</p>
<p>Homecare agencies must vet homecare workers before engaging them by taking up references and carrying out <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service"">Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS)</a> checks on potential employees. Homecare agencies can also:</p>
<ul>
    <li>take over the burden of being an employer <span style=""white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;text-transform:none;float:none;color:#585858;font:13px/18px arial, helvetica, sans-serif;display:inline !important;letter-spacing:normal;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);text-indent:0px"">– </span>for example, payroll, training, disciplinary issues and insurance   </li>
    <li>train their homecare workers through national qualifications and service-specific training </li>
    <li>replace workers when they are ill, on holiday or resign </li>
    <li>put things right when they go wrong </li>
</ul>
<p>An agency will want to see you and the person you're looking after so that they can assess your needs. This also means that a joint decision can be made about the most appropriate type of care and support.</p>
<p>You can find out more from the <a href=""http://www.ukhca.co.uk/"">UK Homecare Association</a>.</p>
<h3>What are the disadvantages of using a homecare agency?</h3>
<p>The main disadvantage is the cost of using an agency. The agency will charge a fee on top of the payment made to the care worker to cover their running costs and profit.</p>
<p>You normally have to make a regular payment to the agency, which includes both the worker’s earnings and the agency’s fee.</p>
<h3>Questions to ask when using a homecare agency</h3>
<p>The fees some agencies charge can be quite high. Before deciding to go ahead with an agency, you should ask questions about the fee and what it covers, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Does the agency check references?  </li>
    <li>What training and supervision do they provide?  </li>
    <li>What is their complaints policy?  </li>
    <li>Who will be responsible for insurance?  </li>
    <li>Is there any out-of-hours or emergency contact if needed?  </li>
    <li>Will they be able to provide staff if your own care worker is ill or away? (If an agency contracts to provide care every day, it must ensure that it does.)  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Hiring a personal assistant</h3>
<p>You can hire a &quot;personal assistant&quot; to act as a homecare worker for you. </p>
<p>Personal assistants can offer you all that you’ll get from an agency worker, but you’ll also get the continuity, familiarity and ongoing relationship with your assistant.</p>
<p>However, if you employ a personal assistant, you will then have the legal responsibility of an employer. This will include arranging cover for their illness and holidays.</p>
<p>GOV.UK has more <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/employing-staff"">information on becoming an employer</a>, while Which? Elderly Care also has advice on <a href=""http://www.which.co.uk/elderly-care/housing-options/home-care-support-services-and-help-at-home/342905-employing-private-individuals"">employing private individuals</a>.</p>
<h3>Homecare from charities</h3>
<p>Charities such as <a href=""http://www.ageuk.org.uk/"">Age UK</a> and <a href=""http://www.carers.org/"">Carers Trust</a> can provide home help and domestic assistance services. The Carers Trust supports carers by giving them a break from their caring responsibilities through homecare services.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.mariecurie.org.uk/en-GB/nurses-hospices/"">Marie Curie Nurses</a> can provide practical and emotional support for people near the end of their lives in their own homes.</p>
<h2>Safeguarding vulnerable groups</h2>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service"">DBS</a> makes decisions about who is unsuitable to work or volunteer with vulnerable adults or children. It makes this decision based on information held by various agencies and government departments.</p>
<p>The service decides who is unsuitable to work or volunteer with vulnerable adults or children. </p>
<p>If someone who is barred from working with children or vulnerable adults is working, volunteering or trying to work or volunteer with these groups, they are breaking the law. They could face a fine and up to five years in prison. </p>
<p>Employers must apply for an <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/disclosure-barring-service-check/overview"">enhanced DBS check</a> (formerly known as a CRB check) when taking on new employees or volunteers to work with vulnerable adults or children. This includes a check of the barred lists. If an organisation fails to make the relevant checks, they can be penalised. </p>
<p>If an organisation dismisses an employee or volunteer for harming a child or vulnerable adult, they must tell the DBS. The DBS must also be notified if any employee or volunteer harms a child or vulnerable adult, but isn't dismissed because they leave voluntarily. If their organisation does not tell DBS, they will be acting illegally.</p>
<p>Questions can be answered by the DBS call centre on 0870 909 0811, or by <a href=""mailto:customerservices@dbs.gsi.gov.uk"">email</a>.</p>
<h2>Employing a care worker on a private basis</h2>
<p>If you employ a care worker privately, you will not be obliged to use the DBS scheme, but you can use it if you choose to. You need to ask social services or the police to make the checks on your behalf. The care worker must have already applied to be vetted, and must consent to the check.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about the suitability of someone you employ privately to work with a vulnerable adult or child, you can ask social services to investigate the matter. They can refer the worker to the ISA on your behalf.</p>
<h2>Manual handling</h2>
<p>If you need help to move, or you need someone to lift you (such as getting out of bed or getting on to the toilet), this can put the person doing the lifting at risk of injury.</p>
<p>This &quot;manual handling&quot; can result in back pain and in the most serious cases, permanent disability if not done correctly.</p>
<p>The law says that employers must take reasonable precautions to ensure their employees don't do any manual handling that carries a risk of them being injured. This applies to you if you directly employ a personal assistant to care for you (but most likely will not if you hire someone through an agency). It is particularly important to consider insurance in this situation. This would cover any risk of the care worker injuring themselves, as well as any risk of them causing an injury.</p>
<p>There are rules around the <a href=""http://www.hse.gov.uk/risk"">risk assessments you need to carry out</a>, and the <a href=""http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg143.pdf"" title=""Opens in new window"" target=""_blank"">Health and Safety Executive produces advice on safe manual handling (PDF, 443kb)</a>.</p>

<div class=""image""><img alt="""" src=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/PublishingImages/CARE%20AND%20SUPPORT/TYPES%20OF%20CARE%20SERVICES/care-homes_364x200_78530808.jpg""></div>
</div>
<p>If you're looking for a residential care home, there's a huge variety of options available. There are permanent care homes for older people, homes for younger adults with disabilities, and homes for children.</p>
<p>Care homes may be privately owned or run by charities or councils. Some will be small care homes based in home-like domestic dwellings, while others will be based in large communal centres.</p>
<p>One of the first options you have to consider when choosing residential care is whether you need the care home to provide nursing care, or just standard personal care.</p>
<h2>Consider other options for care first</h2>
<p>Going into a care home is a major commitment for your future – it involves changing where you live and potentially committing to paying a considerable amount of money for your ongoing accommodation and care needs.</p>
<p>Before you opt for a move to a care home, you should think about other less disruptive – and potentially less costly – options, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/home-care.aspx"">home care</a> </li>
    <li><a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/supported-living-services.aspx"">help to live independently at home</a> </li>
    <li>a &quot;<a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/shared-lives.aspx"">shared lives</a>&quot; or &quot;adult placement&quot; scheme – usually suitable for the needs of younger disabled adults (aged 18 to 64) </li>
</ul>
<p>You should also consider whether you really need the amount of care on offer at a care home, and look at alternatives such as &quot;extra care&quot; housing schemes or warden-controlled sheltered accommodation. These options offer independence with an increased level of care and support.</p>
<h2>Personal care or nursing care?</h2>
<p>Care homes for older people may provide personal care or nursing care. A care home registered to provide personal care will offer support, ensuring basic personal needs are taken care of. A care home providing personal care only can assist you with meals, bathing, going to the toilet and taking medication, if you need this sort of help. <a href=""/Service-Search/Care-home-without-nursing/LocationSearch/1832"">Find care homes without nursing</a>.</p>
<p>Some residents may need nursing care, and some care homes are registered to provide this. These are often referred to as nursing homes. For example, a care home might specialise in certain types of disability or conditions such as <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-and-care-homes.aspx"">dementia</a>. <a href=""/Service-Search/Care-home-with-nursing/LocationSearch/1831"">Find care homes with nursing</a>.</p>
<h2>Care homes for adults aged 18 to 65</h2>
<p>There are also residential care homes that provide care and support for younger adults with, for example, severe physical disabilities, learning disabilities, brain injury resulting from an accident, or mental health problems.</p>
<p>They can care for adults with more than one condition, and some homes will have expertise in providing care for adults with alcohol or drug dependency. These care homes may offer permanent residence or provide care for a temporary period.</p>
<h2>Residential care for children and adolescents</h2>
<p>Some care homes specialise in providing residential care for children with physical disabilities, <a href=""/livewell/childrenwithalearningdisability/Pages/Childrenwithalearningdisabilityhome.aspx"">learning disabilities</a> or emotional problems.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.specialneedsuk.org/findaschool.asp"">Residential special schools</a> focus on education and provide teaching on-site.</p>
<p>In some cases, care homes for children offer &quot;transition&quot; support for young people until they reach their early 20s.</p>
<h2>Choice of care home</h2>
<p>The law says that where the local authority is funding accommodation, it must allow a person entering residential care to choose which care home they would prefer, within reason.</p>
<p>Social services must first agree the home is suitable for your needs and it would not cost more than you would normally pay for a home that would meet those needs.</p>
<p>Local authority help with the cost of residential care is means-tested. You are free to make your own arrangements if you can afford the long-term cost. However, it is worth asking the local authority for a <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/local-authority-funding-for-care.aspx"">financial assessment</a>, because it might pay some or all of your care costs. </p>
<p>In the financial assessment, the local authority can only take into account income and assets you own. The local authority cannot ask members of your family to pay for the basic cost of your care. Read more about <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/local-authority-funding-for-care.aspx"">local authority funding for care</a> and <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/funding-your-own-care-self-funder.aspx"">funding your own care</a>.</p>
<p>If you choose a care home that costs more than the local authority usually expects to pay for a person with your needs, you may still be able to live in the care home if a relative or friend is willing and able to pay the difference between what the local authority pays and the amount the care home charges – this is known as a &quot;top-up&quot; fee. </p>
<p>However, if their situation changes and they are no longer able to pay the top-up, the local authority may have no obligation to continue to fund the more expensive care home place and you may have to move out. It is worth thinking about this potentially difficult situation when deciding on care home options. Read more about <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/local-authority-funding-for-care.aspx#top-ups"">topping up</a>.</p>
<p>Do not cancel your tenancy or sell your home until the final decision has been made by the local authority. The value of your home must not be included in the local authority's means-testing until 12 weeks after you've confirmed that the care home placement will be permanent.</p>
<p>The Care Act 2014 is changing how people are able to pay for their own care, introducing the right for you to ask for the local authority to pay for the cost of your care while you try to sell your home. This is known as a &quot;<a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/local-authority-funding-for-care.aspx#deferred-payment"">deferred payment scheme</a>&quot;.</p>
<h3>Choosing a care home if you're funding your own care</h3>
<p>If you are <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/funding-your-own-care-self-funder.aspx"">funding your own care</a>, you have a great deal of options, and you will need to do a lot of research on which care home provides the best options for you in terms of its cost, location, services, and a host of other potential factors. Read on for tips on choosing your care home.</p>
<p>One of the best places to start is by searching a <a href=""/Service-Search/Care-home-with-nursing/LocationSearch/1831"">directory of care homes with nursing</a>, or searching a <a href=""/Service-Search/Care-home-without-nursing/LocationSearch/1832"">directory of care homes without nursing</a>.</p>
<h3>Choosing a care home if you're having care provided by the local authority</h3>
<p>After a needs assessment from social services, you will be provided with a care plan, which should make clear whether you need residential care and what other options, if any, might be available and most appropriate based on your needs.</p>
<p>Even if you're unlikely to be eligible for financial help with residential care home fees, it could still be worth involving social services. The needs assessment, and information they provide, are likely to be very helpful in making decisions about care. </p>
<h3>Tips on choosing a care home</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Check the most recent inspection report to see how well the care home is doing and if there is anything of concern. You can get inspection reports by searching for the care home on the <a href=""http://www.cqc.org.uk/search/services/care-homes"">Care Quality Commission website</a> or <a href=""http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/types-of-providers-ofsted-inspects"">Ofsted</a> for children's care homes. </li>
    <li>Consider the location of a care home. Is the care home near family and friends? Are there shops, leisure or educational facilities in the area? Is the area noisy? </li>
    <li>Is the care home focused on the residents' individual needs, or do they insist that residents adapt to their routine?  </li>
    <li>What arrangements are there for visitors? Can residents come and go as they please, as far as it is safe to do so? Are staff able to help residents to go out? Are outings arranged? </li>
    <li>What involvement would you have in the care home? How would you communicate with staff? Are there any support groups or regular meetings? </li>
    <li>If safety and security are issues, what arrangements or supervision can the care home provide?  </li>
    <li>Will the care home meet your specific religious, ethnic, cultural or social needs? Will the correct diet be provided? Will the right language be spoken? Will there be opportunities to participate in religious activities? Do they allow pets? </li>
    <li>When you are choosing accommodation it may be a lifelong decision, so you may want to think about <a href=""/Planners/end-of-life-care/Pages/planning-ahead.aspx"">planning for end of life care</a> at the same time. </li>
    <li>You might also want to check what people who have used the care home say about it from <a href=""/Service-Search/Care-homes-and-care-at-home/LocationSearch/11"">online feedback and review services</a>, such as those put together on NHS Choices. </li>
    <li>Ask for a temporary stay in the care home before you decide. Temporary stays in care homes can also be arranged in certain circumstances, such as <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/hospital-discharge-care.aspx"">after a stay in hospital</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>A good care home will:</p>
<ul>
    <li>offer new residents and their families or carers a guide (in a variety of accessible formats) describing what they can expect while they're living there</li>
    <li>have staff who have worked there for a long time, know the residents well, and are friendly, supportive and respectful</li>
    <li>employ well-trained staff, particularly where specialist care such as dementia nursing is required</li>
    <li>involve residents, carers and their families in decision-making</li>
    <li>support residents in doing things for themselves and maximising their independence</li>
    <li>offer a choice of tasty and nutritious food, and provide a variety of leisure and social activities taking residents' needs into account</li>
    <li>be a clean, bright and hygienic environment that's adapted appropriately for residents, with single bedrooms available</li>
    <li>respect residents' privacy, modesty, dignity and choices</li>
    <li>be accredited under the <a href=""http://www.goldstandardsframework.org.uk/accredited-care-homes"">Gold Standards Framework</a> for end of life care</li>
</ul>
<p>An unsatisfactory care home might:</p>
<ul>
    <li>have a code of practice, but not adhere to it</li>
    <li>fail to take into account residents' needs and wishes, with most decisions made by staff</li>
    <li>let residents' care plans become out of date, or fail to reflect their needs accurately</li>
    <li>have staff who enter residents' rooms without knocking, and talk about residents within earshot of other people</li>
    <li>deny residents their independence – for example, by not allowing someone to feed themselves because it &quot;takes too long&quot;</li>
    <li>have staff who don't make an effort to interact with residents and leave them sitting in front of the TV all day</li>
    <li>be in a poorly maintained building, with rooms that all look the same and have little choice in furnishings</li>
    <li>need cleaning, with shared bathrooms that aren't cleaned regularly</li>
</ul>
<h2>If you move into a care home</h2>
<p>When you go into a care home, make sure the management and staff of the home know about your condition, disability and other needs. They may have some of this information already – for example, if the local authority has set up the placement after a care needs assessment.</p>
<p>Moving home can be unsettling at the best of times, so when you move into a care home, it's good to have it planned in advance and have family or friends around you when you move to make you feel more comfortable.</p>
<p>You should also:</p>
<ul>
    <li>contact the benefits office, if you have one (including disability benefits, as these can be affected by care home stays)</li>
    <li>make sure other services at your previous address have been notified</li>
    <li>let friends and family know your know contact details and when you might feel up to receiving visitors</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rights of care home residents</h3>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.cqc.org.uk/"">Care Quality Commission (CQC)</a> is the regulator of health and adult social care in England, whether it's provided by the NHS, local authorities, private companies or voluntary organisations.</p>
<p>Under existing rules, independent healthcare and adult social services must be registered with the CQC. NHS providers, such as hospitals and ambulance services, must also be registered. </p>
<p>The registration of organisations reassures the public when they receive a care service or treatment. It also enables the CQC to check that organisations are continuing to meet CQC standards.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.cqc.org.uk/content/standards-care-homes"">Standards for care homes</a> are outlined on the CQC website. These standards are underpinned by regulations governing the quality and safety of services.</p>
<p>The regulations are enforceable by law – the CQC can enforce fines, public warnings, or even suspend or close a service if they believe people's basic rights or safety are at risk.</p>
<h2>Care home closures</h2>
<p>Care homes will sometimes close. This can be because the owner decides not to carry on providing the service in that location (for instance, if they retire), or because the home has been sold or failed to meet legal standards.</p>
<p>Proposals to close a care home can obviously cause great distress. If the care home is operated by the local authority, it has to follow a consultation process with residents and families. </p>
<p>It may be best to get specialist legal advice in this situation. You can find an appropriate solicitor through the <a href=""http://solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk/"">Law Society</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>Your carer's assessment may identify that you need a break from caring from time to time. Equally, the person you care for may also want to have a break without you. See <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/accessible-activities-breaks-day-trips.aspx"">Accessible day trips and activities</a> for help planning their trip. </p>
<h2>Replacement care and respite care</h2>
<p>Replacement care is designed to replace the care that you, as a carer, would normally be giving the person you care for. It may be needed so you can look after your own health and wellbeing, and to take a break from caring. For example, it may be that regular replacement overnight care is needed so you can catch up on your own sleep. </p>
<p>In certain situations, respite (temporary) care may be provided by your local authority after your <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/carers-assessment.aspx"">carer's assessment</a> or after the <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/assessment-care-needs.aspx"">person you care for has had an assessment</a>. You can use the directory of <a href=""/Service-Search/Carers/LocationSearch/1796"">local carers' services</a> to find your nearest local carers' centre or respite service. Your local authority or local carers' centre can give you information about local support. </p>
<div class=""col-image""><img alt="""" style=""border-top:0px solid;border-right:0px solid;border-bottom:0px solid;float:left;border-left:0px solid"" src=""/choiceintheNHS/Yourchoices/GPchoice/PublishingImages/Tip_C.jpg""></div>
<p><strong>Carer's tip from </strong><a href=""https://community.scope.org.uk/tips""><strong>Scope</strong></a> </p>
<p>&quot;Some hospices provide respite care; we have found this very helpful. They offer high-level care, which means you can feel comfortable your family member is being cared for properly.&quot;</p>
<h2>Breaks for carers</h2>
<p>After your carer's assessment, you may agree with your local authority that you need a break as part of your support plan. If the local authority has agreed to fund the breaks in your care plan, you should be able to choose how you can get your break.</p>
<h3>Using direct payments to get time off caring</h3>
<p>After your assessment, if you are eligible for support, your local authority will develop a support plan with you. This will include a personal budget, which you can choose to have as a direct payment. </p>
<p>For example, you may choose to: </p>
<ul>
    <li>hire a care worker through an agency so you can go on a shopping trip </li>
    <li>use the direct payment to pay for a supported holiday for both you and the person you care for – the <a href=""http://www.shortbreaksnetwork.org.uk/"">Short Breaks Network</a> can provide more information on this </li>
</ul>
<h3>Alternatives to direct payments</h3>
<p>You may also want to consider funding or getting a break from caring by:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href=""#replacement"">asking for care organised by your local authority</a> </li>
    <li><a href=""#charity"">getting funding from a benevolent fund or charity</a> </li>
    <li><a href=""#paying"">paying for a break yourself</a> </li>
    <li><a href=""#bursaries"">accessing bursaries and low-cost holidays</a> </li>
    <li><a href=""#leisure"">getting leisure discounts</a> </li>
    <li><a href=""#friends"">asking friends and family to help</a> </li>
</ul>
<h2><span id=""replacement"">Replacement</span> care provided by the local authority</h2>
<p>Instead of a direct payment, you could ask the local authority to arrange services for you so you can have a break. You can also use a direct payment to fund traditional forms of respite care, and you can pool your direct payments with other people's to fund services such as day centres.</p>
<p>Some local authorities provide vouchers (sometimes called respite grants, or carers' grants) that can be exchanged for services, such as those offered by care agencies or residential homes. You might be able to use vouchers to pay for extra costs associated with your holiday, including live-in care workers, short-stay residential care, or the cost of more homecare.</p>
<p>You might want to consider:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/home-care.aspx"">homecare services</a> – these can either be day services that give you the chance to do an activity inside or outside the home, or night services that can help you get a proper night's sleep, or helpers coming to the home of the person you're caring for. Different types of help can be organised, including sitting with the person you care for and keeping them company, preparing meals, and helping them to get up, washed and dressed. The care workers who come to your home can also provide social activities, such as taking the person you care for to the cinema, pub or shopping. </li>
    <li><a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/care-homes.aspx"">residential or nursing care</a> – this is where the person you're looking after goes for a short stay in a residential or nursing home. If you can, visit the care or nursing home beforehand so you can see what it's like.  </li>
    <li>day care – this is where the person you're looking after goes to a day centre or takes part in activities away from home. </li>
</ul>
<p>If the replacement care provided is essentially a homecare service for the person needing care and allows you to take a break, it should be considered a service provided to the cared-for person and should therefore be charged to them, not you as the carer. Find out more in <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/carers-assessment.aspx"">Carer's assessment</a>.</p>
<h2><span id=""charity"">Benevolent</span> funds or charity funding</h2>
<p>You may be able to get help with the cost of going on holiday – either alone or with the person you care for – from a charity or benevolent fund. Your social worker, GP, health visitor or local carers' support group can give you more information on local benevolent funds and other possible sources of funding. </p>
<p>You might find help from the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href=""http://www.saga.co.uk/saga-charitable-foundation/saga-respite-for-carers-trust.aspx"">Saga Respite for Carers Trust</a> provides a limited number of free holidays each year for carers over the age of 50 and the people they look after. </li>
    <li>The <a href=""http://www.familyfund.org.uk/"">Family Fund</a> can provide grants towards the cost of holidays for families on a low income who are caring for a child with a severe disability. </li>
    <li>The <a href=""http://www.fhaonline.org.uk/"">Family Holiday Association</a> is a UK charity providing breaks at holiday sites, or grants to help with the cost of a holiday, to low-income families in need of a holiday away from home. You need to be referred by your social worker, GP or health visitor, or by a charity or other welfare agent. </li>
    <li>The <a href=""http://www.cchf-allaboutkids.org.uk/"">Children's Country Holiday Fund</a> provides respite breaks in the countryside for young carers aged 6 to 16 and disadvantaged children and young people. </li>
</ul>
<h2><span id=""paying"">Paying</span> for your own breaks</h2>
<p>If after a carer's assessment the local authority decides it will not fund a break for you, you can still decide to pay for your own break from caring. How you go about this will depend on your budget and the <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/funding-care.aspx"">care options</a> available to you locally.</p>
<h2><span id=""bursaries"">Bursaries</span> and low-cost holidays</h2>
<p>Some charities offer low-cost holidays or bursaries to families.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The national charity Diabetes UK offers <a href=""http://www.diabetes.org.uk/How_we_help/Care-events/Childrens-holidays/"">support holidays for children with diabetes</a> aged 7 to 18. Holidays are low cost and a bursary can be offered to families who can't afford the travel costs to the UK holiday site. Further information can be found on the Diabetes UK website or on 020 7424 1000 (ask for the care support team). </li>
    <li><a href=""http://www.turn2us.org.uk/"">Turn2us</a>, an independent charity, can help you find sources of financial support based on your particular needs and circumstances. </li>
    <li>Saga, the organisation for people aged 50 and older, has a range of holidays and short breaks to suit carers, including group holidays, holidays for single travellers, special interest holidays, and cruises. Holidays are run throughout the year in the UK and abroad. Saga also offers free holidays for carers through the <a href=""http://www.saga.co.uk/saga-charitable-foundation/saga-respite-for-carers-trust.aspx"">Saga Respite for Carers Trust</a>. </li>
</ul>
<h2><span id=""leisure"">Leisure</span> discounts</h2>
<p>Many local authorities offer leisure cards. These can help you pay for activities you might like to do when you get a break from caring.</p>
<p>They're often available to people claiming benefits such as Income Support, Employment and Support Allowance, Carer's Allowance and benefits for disabled people, students over 18 in full-time education, and people over 60. </p>
<p>The eligibility requirements vary between areas, but there's a good chance you'll qualify if you're a carer with a low income.</p>
<p>Local authorities might make a small annual charge for the card, from £1 up to around £15. You'll probably be asked for some proof of your entitlement, such as a statement of entitlement for Income Support or an official letter.</p>
<p>Discount leisure cards can give you discounts of between 10 and 50% on activities, services and entertainment. These range from sporting activities at local leisure centres to cinemas, theatres, libraries, museums, hairdressers and beauty salons.</p>
<h2><span id=""friends"">Help</span> with caring from friends and family</h2>
<p>Friends and family can provide support for you and the person you care for, especially when you need a break from caring. However, they are not the same as paid professional care workers, and regular caring can place the same stresses on them as on you. They may also be unable or unwilling to commit to giving you a break when you need it.</p>
<p>Make sure anyone who takes over from you has all the information they need to look after the person you care for. This may include what they like to eat and at what time, as well as more complex information about the medicines they need to take.</p>
<p>Leave a clear list of contacts. These should include the doctor's number, those of nearby family members and friends, and your own number in case of emergencies. If you have an <a href=""#emergency"">emergency plan</a>, go through it with the people who will be providing replacement care.</p>
<p>If the person you care for needs specialist medical or nursing help while you're away, arrange this through their GP. This specialist help can include visits from a district nurse or from a community psychiatric nurse. There is no charge for this healthcare, but each NHS body decides what care it will provide.</p>
<h2><span id=""emergency"">Help</span> with emergency planning</h2>
<p>Thinking about what you would do in an emergency should be part of the discussion you have as part of your carer's assessment. The person who carries out your assessment should be able to help you with planning. </p>

<p><strong>Carer's tip from </strong><a href=""https://community.scope.org.uk/tips""><strong>Scope</strong></a> </p>
<p>&quot;It might be a good idea to choose someone from your family to be the person's guardian in case of death. You should ensure that person is familiar, and keep them up-to-date with needs.&quot;</p>
<p>To create an emergency plan, you will need to note down details of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the name, address and any other contact details of the person you look after </li>
    <li>who you and the person you look after would like to be contacted in an emergency – this could be friends, family or professional people involved in the person's care </li>
    <li>any medication the person is taking </li>
    <li>any ongoing treatment they need </li>
</ul>
<p>You can register with a carers emergency scheme in your area. If you do, a skilled worker trained to look at your individual situation may be able to help you make your emergency plans.</p>
<h3>Who can help make an emergency plan?</h3>
<p>Every carer who has an assessment should be asked about emergencies and offered help to plan for them.</p>
<p>The social worker involved in your carer's assessment should be able to help you with emergency planning.</p>

<div class=""image""><img alt="""" style=""border-top:0px solid;border-right:0px solid;border-bottom:0px solid;border-left:0px solid"" src=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/PublishingImages/INFORMATION%20FOR%20CARERS/carers-care-act_364x200_155379275.jpg""></div>
</div>
<p>A carer is someone who helps another person, usually a relative or friend, in their day-to-day life. This is not the same as someone who provides care professionally or through a voluntary organisation.</p>
<p>The Care Act 2014 sets out carers' legal rights to assessment and support. It came into force in April 2015.</p>
<p>The <a shape=""rect"" href=""http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/23/contents/enacted/data.htm"" shape=""rect"">Care Act</a> relates mostly to adult carers – people aged 18 and over who are caring for another adult. This is because young carers (aged under 18) and adults who care for disabled children can be assessed and supported under children's law.</p>
<p>However, regulations under the Act allow the government to make rules about looking at family circumstances when assessing an adult's need for care, which means, for example, making sure the position of a <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/young-carers-rights.aspx"" shape=""rect"">young carer</a> within a family is not overlooked. </p>
<p>The Act also contains new rules about working with young carers or adult carers of disabled children to plan an effective and <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/transition-planning-disabled-young-people.aspx"" shape=""rect"">timely move to adult care and support</a>.</p>
<h2>What does the Care Act do?</h2>
<p>Previously, carers didn't have a legal right to receive support, although local authorities could provide support at their discretion. This meant that the ability to have an assessment and access a range of support varied depending on where you lived.</p>
<p>The Care Act gives local authorities a responsibility to assess a carer's need for support, where the carer appears to have such needs. This replaced the law which said the carer must be providing &quot;a substantial amount of care on a regular basis&quot; to qualify for an assessment.</p>
<p>This means more carers are now able to have an assessment. The local authority will assess whether the carer has needs and what those needs may be. This assessment will consider the impact of caring on the carer. </p>
<p>It will also consider the things a carer wants to achieve in their own day-to-day life. It must also consider other important issues, such as whether the carer is able or willing to carry on caring, whether they work or want to work, and whether they want to study or do more socially.</p>
<p>If both the carer and the person they care for agree, a combined assessment of both their needs can be undertaken.</p>
<h2>I'm a carer. Am I eligible for support?</h2>
<p>When the <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/carers-assessment.aspx"" shape=""rect"">carer's assessment</a> is complete, the local authority must decide whether the carer's needs are eligible for support from the local authority. This approach is similar to that used for adults with care and support needs. </p>
<p>In the case of carers, eligibility depends on the carer's situation. The carer will be entitled to support if:</p>
<ul>
    <li>they are assessed as having needs that meet the eligibility criteria  </li>
    <li>the person they care for lives in the local authority area (which means their established home is in that local authority area) </li>
</ul>
<p>If there is a charge (as there sometimes may be, as explained below), it has to be accepted by the carer (or the adult being cared for, if it falls to them).</p>
<h2>Support planning for carers</h2>
<p>The local authority and the carer will agree a support plan, which sets out how the carer's needs will be met. This could include, for example, help with housework or buying a laptop to keep in touch with family and friends.</p>
<p>It may be that the best way to meet a carer's needs is to provide care and support directly to the person they care for – for example, by providing replacement care to allow someone to take a break from caring. It's possible to do this as long as the person needing care agrees.</p>
<h2>Charging and financial assessment for carers</h2>
<p>In most cases, local authorities don't charge for providing support to carers, in recognition of the valuable contribution carers make to their local community. But this is something the local authority can decide. </p>
<p>If the local authority does decide to charge a carer for providing them with support, it must carry out a financial assessment to decide whether the carer can afford to pay.</p>
<p>If supporting a carer involves providing care to the person being cared for and the local authority chooses to charge for that type of care, the authority must carry out a financial assessment of the person who is being cared for.</p>
<p>This is because the care would be provided directly to that adult, and not to the carer. The Act makes it clear that in such cases, the carer cannot be charged.</p>
<h3>Personal budgets for carers</h3>
<p>Carers should receive a personal budget, which is a statement showing the cost of meeting their needs, as part of their support plan. It will include the amount the carer will pay, if any, and the amount the local authority is going to pay. </p>
<p>Carers have the right to request that the local authority meets some or all of such needs by giving them a <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/direct-payments-personal-budgets.aspx"" shape=""rect"">direct payment</a>, which will give them control over how their support is provided.</p>
<h2>The Care Act and young carers</h2>
<p>The Care Act does not deal with the assessment of people under the age of 18 who care for others. However, young carers can be supported under the law relating to children. The Children and Families Act gives young carers (and parent carers) similar rights to assessment as other carers have under the Care Act.</p>
<p>Regulations under the Care Act set out how assessments of adults must be carried out to ensure the needs of the whole family are considered. This could include assessing what an adult needs to enable them to fulfil their parental responsibilities towards their children, or to ensure that young people do not undertake inappropriate caring responsibilities.</p>
<p>Find out more about <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/who-can-help-young-carers.aspx"" shape=""rect"">who can help young carers</a>.</p>
<h2>Adults caring for disabled children</h2>
<p>An adult caring for a disabled child can get support through children's services. This is usually the best way to meet their needs, so they are not covered by this Act.</p>
<p>However, there is provision in the Act for an adult carer of a disabled child to ask for an assessment of their caring needs before the child reaches 18. </p>
<p>When a local authority carries out such an assessment, it has the power to provide support to the carer, even though they are caring for a child, rather than an adult. This would, for example, enable a local authority to provide the support available through an adult carers' centre.</p>
<h2>Young carers: transitioning to adult services </h2>
<p>The Act says adult social services need to be involved in planning the support a young carer may need once they reach 18. This also applies to adult carers of children where it appears likely that the adult carer will have needs for support after the child turns 18.</p>

</div>
<p>A young carer is someone aged 18 or under who helps look after a relative who has a condition, such as a disability, illness, mental health condition, or a drug or alcohol problem.</p>
<p>Most young carers look after one of their parents or care for a brother or sister. They do extra jobs in and around the home, such as cooking, cleaning, or helping someone to get dressed and move around. </p>
<p>Some children give a lot of physical help to a brother or sister who is disabled or ill. Along with doing things to help your brother or sister, you may also be giving emotional support to both your sibling and your parents.</p>
<h2>Your choices about caring</h2>
<p>Some people start caring at a very young age and don't really realise they are carers. Other young people become carers overnight. If someone in your family needs to be looked after, you may really want to help them.</p>
<p>But, young carers shouldn't do the same things as adult carers, nor should they be spending a lot of their time caring for someone, as this can get in the way of them doing well at school and doing the same kinds of things as other children or young people.</p>
<p>It's important you decide how much and what type of care you're willing or able to give, or whether you should be a carer at all.</p>
<p>You need to decide whether you're the right person to offer the care that the person you look after needs. All disabled adults are entitled to support from their local authority, depending on their needs, so they should not have to rely on their children to care for them. It's important for social services to ensure the whole family feels supported and comfortable with your role. </p>
<p>Find out more about <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/who-can-help-young-carers.aspx"">who can help young carers</a>.</p>
<h2>Young carers' rights </h2>
<p>The law is changing for young carers, and from April 2015 a social worker from your local authority must visit to carry out a “young carers needs assessment” to decide what kind of help you and your family might need if you or your parents request this. </p>
<p>If the local authority has already carried out one of these assessments before, they must carry out another one if you or your parents feel that your needs or circumstances have changed.</p>
<p>A young carer’s needs assessment must decide whether it is appropriate for you to care for someone else – and this includes taking into account whether you want to be a carer. The local authority must also look at your education, training, leisure opportunities and your views about your future. When assessing a young carer they must always ask about your wishes and involve you, your parents and anyone else you or your parents want to be involved.</p>
<p>All these people should receive a written record of the assessment. This should include whether the local authority thinks you need support, whether their services could provide you with that support, and whether they will give you that support. It should also explain what you can do if you or your parents disagree with the assessment.</p>
<p>Provided that you both agree, the local authority can assess both your needs as a young carer and the needs of the person you care for, at the same time.</p>
<p>If you’re 16 or over, and you’re not in full-time education you may be eligible for help <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/returning-to-work-as-a-carer.aspx"">finding work</a><strong> </strong>as well as help with your family’s finances, for instance through benefits such as <a href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/carers-allowance.aspx"">Carer’s Allowance</a>. Your assessment is the best place to find out about what is available in your situation.</p>

<p>Below are some commonly asked questions about care and support.</p>
<h2>What are care and support services?</h2>
<p>Care and support services, also known as social care services, help people who are in need of practical support due to illness, disability, old age or a low income. </p>
<p>Care and support services could include having a personal assistant to help you around the home, structural changes to help you move around or manage in your house, or even an alarm system so that you can call for help if you have a fall.</p>
<p>Social care services are available to everyone, regardless of their background.</p>
<p>However, social care is subject to rules about your needs and ability. Services can also support the families or carers of people who receive social care. Find out more about your <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/Care-Act-2014-overview.aspx"" shape=""rect"">rights and entitlements to social care</a>.</p>
<h2>How are care and support services funded?</h2>
<p>Local authorities (councils) are responsible for providing social care services for those who need them and are eligible for them. After assessing your needs and finances, the local authority may agree to pay for some or all of the care and support you need. These council-funded social care services may be provided by ‘independent providers’ – firms or charities that specialise in providing social care services. Find out more about <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/funding-care.aspx"" shape=""rect"">funding care services</a>.</p>
<p>Even though most people have to fund all or part of their own care and support, local authorities have a duty to assess everyone’s care and support needs, and advise you on relevant local services.</p>
<p>Social care services can take many forms – you can get help from them while you live at home, out and about in the community, or even in a new place of residence such as a care home. To find out more, read <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/choosing-care-services.aspx"" shape=""rect"">choosing care</a> and <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/how-can-i-get-social-care-support.aspx"" shape=""rect"">arranging care</a>.</p>
<h2>How can social care help disabled people?</h2>
<p>Social care services can help and support people with disabilities to live more independently. Even if you are not eligible for free social care, you may still have a right to receive benefits and other financial help or access to equipment and concessions on transport or the Blue Badge Parking Scheme.</p>
<p>Details on these, together with information on disability rights under the <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/Equality-Act-disability-discrimination.aspx"" shape=""rect"">Equality Act</a> and in the <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/disability-in-the-workplace.aspx"" shape=""rect"">workplace</a>, can be found in this guide and on <a shape=""rect"" href=""https://www.gov.uk/browse/disabilities"" title=""External website"" shape=""rect"">GOV.UK</a>.</p>
<p>Read more about <a shape=""rect"" href=""/LiveWell/Disability"" shape=""rect"">living with a disability</a> with help from social care services.</p>
<h2>How can social care help older people?</h2>
<p>Most local authorities will have a social care team devoted to older people. These teams can <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/equipment-aids-adaptations.aspx"" shape=""rect"">provide support</a> that enables older people to remain living independently in their own home.</p>
<p>The local authority's team for older people will also be able to guide you through the options available if you are no longer able to live at home independently, for instance in sheltered accommodation, extra care housing, or <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/care-homes.aspx"" shape=""rect"">care and nursing homes</a>.</p>
<h2>I look after someone. Can social care help me?</h2>
<p>If you are looking after an ill, disabled or frail elderly relative or friend, you should recognise yourself as a carer. Carers can get a <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/carers-assessment.aspx"" shape=""rect"">range of support</a> from social care, and can be vital for helping arrange social care support for the person they care for. There are charities that support particular groups of carers, including sibling carers and <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/who-can-help-young-carers.aspx"" shape=""rect"">young carers</a>. </p>
<p>If you want to talk to someone about how to get support as a carer, call the Carers Direct helpline on 0300 123 1053.</p>
<h2>How can social care help my child?</h2>
<p>If you're worried about your child's general development or wellbeing and you think they need additional support, you should speak to your child’s GP or teacher first.</p>
<p>If you or your child need more significant support, contact the children’s services team in your local authority for a <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/assessment-care-needs.aspx"" shape=""rect"">needs assessment</a>.</p>
<p>This assessment of your child’s needs will be used to determine if they need more specialised support, including any <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Livewell/Childrenwithalearningdisability/Pages/Education.aspx"" shape=""rect"">special educational needs</a> your child may have. You should be involved in any decisions about your child, including what help will be provided to meet their needs.</p>
<p>This guide also provides <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/caring-for-a-disabled-child-tips.aspx"" shape=""rect"">tips for caring for a disabled child</a> and links to further help.</p>
<h3>Council help for children</h3>
<p>Each local authority will have people dealing specifically with social care for children. Use the GOV.UK website to <a shape=""rect"" href=""https://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-council"" shape=""rect"">find your local council</a> and get advice about an assessment for children’s services.</p>
<h2>How good are my local authority social services?</h2>
<p>If you are receiving care, looking after someone who receives care, or just planning for your future care, it’s worth finding out how well your local authority’s social care services are performing.</p>
<p>You can check how care services in your area are performing against measures in the <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Service-Search/performance/Results?ResultsViewId=1004"" shape=""rect"">Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework (ASCOF)</a>.</p>
<p>This will let you find out how carers and people receiving local authority funded care and support in your area rate:</p>
<ul>
    <li>their quality of life  </li>
    <li>their satisfaction with care services  </li>
    <li>feeling safe </li>
</ul>
<p>Alongside these are the levels of social services that the local authority offers, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the number of people receiving direct payments  </li>
    <li>the number of permanent admissions to care homes </li>
    <li>delayed transfers of care from hospitals </li>
</ul>
<p>You can also compare these with national and regional averages, to see whether your local authority is doing well, or could be performing better.</p>

<p>If you're becoming increasingly forgetful, particularly if you're over the age of 65, it may be a good idea to talk to your GP about the early signs of dementia. </p>
<p>As you get older, you may find that memory loss becomes a problem. It's normal for your memory to be affected by age, stress, tiredness, or certain illnesses and medications. This can be annoying if it happens occasionally, but if it's affecting your daily life or is worrying you or someone you know, you should seek help from your GP.</p>
<div class=""onecol-snippet-right"">
<h3>How common is dementia?</h3>
<p>According to the <a href=""http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/infographic"">Alzheimer's Society</a> there are around 800,000 people in the UK with dementia. One in three people over 65 will develop dementia, and two-thirds of people with dementia are women.</p>
<p>The number of people with dementia is increasing because people are living longer. It is estimated that by 2021, the number of people with dementia in the UK will have increased to around 1 million.</p>

<h2>What is dementia?</h2>
<p>Dementia is a common condition that affects about 800,000 people in the UK. Your risk of developing dementia increases as you get older, and the condition usually occurs in people over the age of 65.</p>
<p>Dementia is a syndrome (a group of related symptoms) associated with an ongoing decline of the brain and its abilities. This includes problems with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>memory loss </li>
    <li>thinking speed </li>
    <li>mental agility </li>
    <li>language </li>
    <li>understanding </li>
    <li>judgement </li>
</ul>
<p>People with dementia can become apathetic or uninterested in their usual activities, and have problems <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-behaviour.aspx"">controlling their emotions</a>. They may also find social situations challenging, lose interest in <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/relationships-and-dementia.aspx"">socialising</a>, and aspects of their personality may change.</p>
<p>A person with dementia may lose empathy (understanding and compassion), they may see or hear things that other people do not (<a href=""/conditions/psychosis/pages/introduction.aspx"">hallucinations</a>), or they may make false claims or statements. </p>
<p>As dementia affects a person's mental abilities, they may find planning and organising difficult. <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/staying-independent-with-dementia.aspx"">Maintaining their independence</a> may also become a problem. A person with dementia will therefore usually need help from friends or relatives, including help with <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-diagnosis-plan.aspx"">decision making</a>.</p>
<p>Your GP will discuss the possible causes of memory loss with you, including dementia. Other symptoms can include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>increasing difficulties with tasks and activities that require concentration and planning </li>
    <li><a href=""/conditions/depression/pages/introduction.aspx"">depression</a> </li>
    <li>changes in personality and mood </li>
    <li>periods of mental confusion </li>
    <li>difficulty finding the right words </li>
</ul>
<p>Most types of dementia can't be cured, but if it is detected early there are ways you can slow it down and maintain mental function.</p>

<h2>Why is it important to get a diagnosis?</h2>
<p>An early diagnosis can help people with dementia get the right treatment and support, and help those close to them to prepare and plan for the future. With treatment and support, many people are able to <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/living-well-with-dementia.aspx"">lead active, fulfilled lives</a>.</p>

                        <p>Dementia is not a disease but a collection of symptoms that result from damage to the brain. These symptoms can be caused by a number of conditions. The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease. </p>
<p>Common symptoms of <a href=""/conditions/alzheimers-disease/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">Alzheimer's disease</a> and other forms of dementia include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>memory loss, especially problems with memory for recent events, such as forgetting messages, remembering routes or names, and asking questions repetitively </li>
    <li>increasing difficulties with tasks and activities that require organisation and planning </li>
    <li>becoming confused in unfamiliar environments </li>
    <li>difficulty finding the right words </li>
    <li>difficulty with numbers and/or handling money in shops </li>
    <li>changes in personality and mood  </li>
    <li>depression </li>
</ul>
<p>Early symptoms of dementia are often mild and may get worse only very gradually. This means that the person with dementia and those around them may not notice these signs or take them seriously for some time. Also, people with dementia sometimes do not recognise that they have any symptoms.</p>
<div class=""imagedivleft-2col"">
<div class=""image""><img alt="""" src=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/PublishingImages/signs-dementia_364x200_122374065.jpg""></div>
</div>
<p>Dementia is progressive. This means that the person's brain will become more damaged and will work less well over time, and their symptoms will tend to change and become more severe. </p>
<p>For this reason, it is important to talk to your GP sooner rather than later if you are worried that you may have problems with your memory.</p>
<p>The speed at which symptoms get worse and the way that they develop will depend on the cause of the person's dementia, their overall health and their circumstances. This means that the symptoms and experience of dementia can vary greatly from person to person. </p>
<p>Some people may also have more than one condition – for example, they may have Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia at the same time.</p>
<p>The symptoms listed above are common in all forms of dementia. However, some types of dementia have other distinctive features. These are explained below. </p>
<h2>Symptoms of vascular dementia</h2>
<p>The symptoms of vascular dementia can sometimes develop suddenly and quickly get worse, although they can also develop gradually over many months or years. People with vascular dementia may also experience stroke-like symptoms, including muscle weakness or paralysis on one side of their body.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of dementia with Lewy bodies</h2>
<p>Dementia with Lewy bodies shares many of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and people with the condition typically also experience the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li>periods of alertness and drowsiness or fluctuating levels of confusion  </li>
    <li>visual hallucinations </li>
    <li>becoming slower in their physical movements </li>
</ul>

<h2>Symptoms of frontotemporal dementia</h2>
<p>Early symptoms of frontotemporal dementia typically include changes in emotion, personality and behaviour. For example, someone with this type of dementia may become less sensitive to other people’s emotions, perhaps making them seem cold and unfeeling.</p>
<p>They may also lose some of their inhibitions, leading to behaviour that is out of character, such as making tactless or inappropriate comments.</p>
<p>Some people with frontotemporal dementia also have language problems. This may include not speaking, speaking less than usual or having problems finding the right words.</p>
<p>Find out more about <a href=""/Conditions/frontotemporal-dementia/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">frontotemporal dementia</a>.</p>
<h2>Symptoms in the later stages of dementia</h2>
<p>As dementia progresses, memory loss and difficulties with communication often become very severe. In the later stages, the person is likely to neglect their own health and require constant care and attention.</p>
<h3>Memory symptoms in dementia</h3>
<p>People with advanced dementia may not recognise close family and friends, they may not remember where they live or know where they are. They may find it impossible to understand simple pieces of information, carry out basic tasks or follow instructions. </p>
<h3>Communication problems in dementia</h3>
<p>It is common for people with dementia to have increasing difficulty speaking and they may eventually lose the ability to speak altogether. It is important to keep trying to communicate with them and to recognise and use other, non-verbal means of communication, such as expression, touch and gestures.</p>
<p>Read more about <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-and-communication.aspx"">communication problems in dementia</a>.</p>
<h3>Problems with mobility in dementia</h3>
<p>Many people with dementia gradually become less able to move about unaided and may appear increasingly clumsy when carrying out everyday tasks. Some people may eventually be unable to walk and may become bedbound.</p>
<p>Read more about <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-care-at-home.aspx#mobility"">mobility</a>.</p>
<h3>Incontinence</h3>
<p>Bladder incontinence is common in the later stages of dementia and some people will also experience bowel <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-carers.aspx#incontinence"">incontinence</a>. </p>
<h3>Eating, appetite and weight loss</h3>
<p>Loss of appetite and weight loss are common in the later stages of dementia. It's important that people with dementia get help at mealtimes to ensure they eat enough. Many people have trouble eating or swallowing and this can lead to choking, chest infections and other problems.  </p>

                        <p>If you are worried about your memory or think you may have dementia, it's a good idea to see your GP. If you're worried about someone else, you should encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest that you go along with them.</p>
<p>Just because you are forgetful, it doesn't mean you have dementia. Memory problems can also be caused by depression, stress, drug side effects, or other health problems. Your GP will be able to run through some simple checks and either reassure you, give you a diagnosis or refer you to a specialist for further tests.</p>
<p>A diagnosis of dementia affects both the person with the condition and those close to them. An early diagnosis gives you both the best chance to prepare and plan for the future, as well as receive any treatment that may be possible. With treatment and support, many people are able to lead active, fulfilling lives.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<h2>What to expect when you see your GP about dementia</h2>
<p>Your GP will ask about your symptoms and other aspects of your health, and will give you a physical examination. The doctor will organise some blood tests and ask about any medication you are taking, as these can sometimes cause symptoms similar to dementia. </p>
<p>You will also be asked some questions or given some mental exercises to measure any problems with your memory or your ability to think clearly.</p>
<p>Find out more about the <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-diagnosis-tests.aspx"" shape=""rect"">tests used to diagnose dementia</a>.</p>
<h2>Referral to a dementia specialist</h2>
<p>Dementia can be difficult to diagnose, especially if your symptoms are only mild. If your GP is unsure about your diagnosis, they will refer you to a specialist such as a neurologist (an expert in treating conditions that affect the brain and nervous system), an elderly care physician, or a psychiatrist with experience of treating dementia. </p>
<p>The specialist may be based in a memory clinic alongside other professionals who are experts in diagnosing, caring for and advising people with dementia and their families.</p>
<p>It's important to make good use of your consultation with the specialist. Write down questions you want to ask, make a note of any medical terms the doctor might use, and ask if you can come back if you think of any more questions you want to ask. Taking the opportunity to go back can be very helpful.</p>
<p>The specialist will organise further tests, which may include brain scans such as a <a shape=""rect"" href=""/conditions/ct-scan/pages/introduction.aspx"" shape=""rect"">computerised tomography (CT) scan</a>, or preferably a <a shape=""rect"" href=""/conditions/mri-scan/pages/introduction.aspx"" shape=""rect"">magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan</a>.</p>
<p>If they are still not certain about the diagnosis, you may need to have further, more complex, tests.</p>
<h2>Getting your dementia diagnosis</h2>
<p>Once you've had the necessary tests, your doctor should ask you if you wish to know your diagnosis and if there is anyone else you would like to be told.</p>
<p>They should explain what having dementia might mean for you, and should give you time to talk more about the condition and ask any questions you may have. </p>
<p>Unless you decide otherwise, your doctor or a member of their team should explain to you and your family:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the type of dementia that you have, or if it is not clear, what the plan to further investigate will entail. Sometimes, despite investigations, a diagnosis may not be clear, in which case the doctors will review you again after a period of time to reassess you </li>
    <li>details about symptoms and how the illness might develop </li>
    <li>treatments </li>
    <li>care and support services in your area </li>
    <li>support groups and voluntary organisations for people with dementia and their families and carers </li>
    <li>advocacy services </li>
    <li>where you can find financial and legal advice  </li>
</ul>
<p>You should also be given written information about dementia.</p>
<h2>Questions to ask about your dementia diagnosis</h2>
<ul>
    <li>please tell me about the type of dementia that I may have </li>
    <li>please give me more details about the tests or investigations I should have </li>
    <li>how long will I have to wait until I have these tests? </li>
    <li>how long will it take to get the results of these tests? </li>
    <li>what will happen after I get the results? </li>
</ul>
<h2>Ongoing dementia assessment </h2>
<p>Once you have been given a diagnosis, your GP should arrange to see you from time to time to see how you're getting on. Because dementia is a progressive condition, the doctor may arrange another appointment with the specialist, perhaps after six months or a year. The GP and the specialist may also jointly prescribe medications that may be helpful in treating some of the symptoms of dementia.</p>
<p>However, not everybody will benefit from these drugs.</p>

                        <p>A range of tests and diagnostic procedures is needed to diagnose dementia. The following are the most commonly used.</p>
<h2>Assessing mental abilities to diagnose dementia</h2>
<div class=""imagedivright-1col""><img alt="""" style=""border-bottom:0px solid;border-left:0px solid;border-top:0px solid;border-right:0px solid"" src=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/PublishingImages/diagnosing_171x200_M8730066.jpg""></div>
<p>Questionnaires are often used to help test the mental abilities of the person with symptoms of dementia, and how severe they are. One widely used test is the mini mental state examination (MMSE). The MMSE assesses a number of different mental abilities, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>short- and long-term memory </li>
    <li>attention span </li>
    <li>concentration </li>
    <li>language and communication skills </li>
    <li>ability to plan </li>
    <li>ability to understand instructions </li>
</ul>
<p>The MMSE is a series of exercises, each carrying a score with a maximum of 30 points. Example exercises include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>memorising a short list of objects and then repeating the list  </li>
    <li>writing a short sentence that is grammatically correct, such as &quot;the dog sat on the floor&quot; </li>
    <li>correctly answering time-orientation questions, such as identifying the day of the week, the date or the year </li>
</ul>
<p>The MMSE is not a test to diagnose dementia. However, it is useful for assessing the level of mental impairment that a person with dementia may have. </p>
<p>Test scores may be influenced by a person's level of education. For example, someone who cannot read or write very well may have a lower score, but they may not have dementia. Similarly, someone with a higher level of education may achieve a higher score but still have dementia.</p>
<h2>Blood tests for dementia</h2>
<p>A person with suspected dementia may have <a shape=""rect"" href=""/conditions/Blood-tests/Pages/Introduction.aspx"" shape=""rect"">blood tests</a> to check their overall level of health and to rule out other conditions that may be responsible for their symptoms, such as thyroid hormones and vitamin B12 levels.</p>
<h2>Dementia brain scans</h2>
<p>Brain scans are usually used for diagnosing dementia. They are needed to check for evidence of other possible problems that could explain a person's symptoms, such as a major <a shape=""rect"" href=""/conditions/Stroke/Pages/Introduction.aspx"" shape=""rect"">stroke</a> or a <a shape=""rect"" href=""/conditions/brain-tumours/Pages/Introduction.aspx"" shape=""rect"">brain tumour</a>.</p>
<p>Several types of brain scan can be used to help diagnose dementia:</p>
<h3>Computerised tomography (CT) scan</h3>
<p>A <a shape=""rect"" href=""/conditions/CT-scan/Pages/Introduction.aspx"" shape=""rect"">computerised tomography (CT) scan</a> can be used to check for signs of stroke or a brain tumour. However, unlike an MRI scan, a CT scan cannot provide detailed information about the structure of the brain.</p>
<h3>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan</h3>
<p>The <a shape=""rect"" href=""http://www.nice.org.uk/"" shape=""rect"">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)</a> recommends using a <a shape=""rect"" href=""/conditions/MRI-scan/Pages/Introduction.aspx"" shape=""rect"">magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan</a> to help confirm a diagnosis of dementia.</p>
<p>An MRI scan can provide detailed information about the blood vessel damage that occurs in <a href=""/Conditions/vascular-dementia/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">vascular dementia</a>, plus any shrinking of the brain (atrophy). In Alzheimer's disease, the whole brain is susceptible to shrinking, whereas in frontotemporal dementia the frontal and temporal lobes are mainly affected by shrinking.</p>
<h3>Other scans and procedures</h3>
<p>Other types of scan, such as a single photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan or a <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/PET-scan/Pages/Introduction.aspx"" shape=""rect"">positron emission tomography (PET) scan</a>, may be recommended if the result of your CT or MRI scan is uncertain. These scans look at how the brain functions and can pick up abnormalities with the blood flow in the brain.</p>
<p>In some cases, an <a href=""/conditions/eeg/pages/introduction.aspx"">electroencephalogram (EEG)</a> may be taken to record the brain's electrical signals (brain activity).</p>
<p>A <a shape=""rect"" href=""/conditions/Lumbar-puncture/Pages/Introduction.aspx"" shape=""rect"">lumbar puncture</a> may also be used to check the protein levels in the brain. This procedure involves taking a sample of spinal fluid from the lower back for testing.</p>

</div>
<p>Dementia, and the difficulties it causes, is one of the most feared health conditions. People with dementia and their families are sometimes reluctant to seek advice when concerned about memory or other problems. But there are many potential benefits to getting medical advice if you're worried. Being diagnosed early is important for many reasons. It helps you to get the right treatments and to find the best sources of support, as well as to make decisions about the future.</p>
<h2>Diagnosis can help uncertainty</h2>
<p>It may not be clear why someone has problems with memory or has a change in behaviour. These problems may be because of dementia, or down to other reasons such as poor sleep, low mood, medications or other medical conditions. This uncertainty can be distressing for both the person experiencing difficulties, and their family and friends. While a diagnosis of dementia can be devastating news, an explanation of what the problem is and what can be done about it can help people feel empowered and reduce some of the worry caused by uncertainty. Some people find it helpful to discuss with doctors and nurses how the dementia may affect them or their loved one in the future, and there is advice available about how to <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/staying-independent-with-dementia.aspx"">stay independent</a> and <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/living-well-with-dementia.aspx"">live well with dementia</a>.    </p>
<h2>Accessing treatments</h2>
<p>Dementia is not a single condition – it refers to difficulties with thinking and memory that may be <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/causes-of-dementia.aspx"">caused by several different underlying diseases</a>. This is one reason why not everyone with dementia experiences the same problems.</p>
<p class=""image"">Identifying that there is a problem, and then diagnosing the underlying cause is important for guiding treatment and accessing services.</p>
<p class=""image"">Some causes of dementia are treatable and reversible (either partially or fully, depending on the nature of the problem). Conditions such as <a href=""/conditions/anxiety/pages/introduction.aspx"">anxiety</a> and <a href=""/Conditions/Depression/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">depression</a>, some vitamin deficiencies, side effects of medications and certain brain tumours fall into this category.</p>
<p class=""image""><a href=""/conditions/alzheimers-disease/pages/introduction.aspx"">Alzheimer’s disease</a> and <a href=""/conditions/dementia-with-lewy-bodies/pages/introduction.aspx"">dementia with Lewy bodies</a> are neurodegenerative conditions, which means they gradually damage the brain. Cholinesterase inhibitor medications have been shown to have benefit in Alzheimer’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. These <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-treatment.aspx"">treatments</a> (donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine) improve symptoms by making the remaining brain cells work a bit harder. Memantine is another medication that can help in Alzheimer’s disease. Although not a cure, these medications can make a significant difference to day-to-day living and functioning.</p>
<p class=""image"">Treating <a href=""/conditions/blood-pressure-(high)/pages/introduction.aspx"">high blood pressure</a>, <a href=""/conditions/cholesterol/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">high cholesterol</a> and poorly controlled <a href=""/conditions/diabetes/pages/diabetes.aspx"">diabetes</a> is also important, as is stopping smoking and keeping to a healthy weight. These factors (known as risk factors) all contribute strongly to vascular dementia, and may make Alzheimer’s disease worse. Your GP will be able to assess your risk factors, advise if treatment is needed and monitor you.  </p>
<p class=""image"">Medications for other conditions can be reviewed in case they are having a negative effect on cognitive functioning.</p>
<h2>Other support</h2>
<p class=""image"">Whether or not there are specific treatments for the cause of the dementia affecting you, having the correct diagnosis is important for getting the right advice and support. There is a lot of help and information available both for people with dementia and their friends, relatives and carers.  </p>
<p class=""image"">This includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    <div class=""image"">Information on help available at home or in the community, such as from <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-and-social-services.aspx"">social services</a>, day centres and respite care, community mental health teams, speech and language therapists, dietitians and occupational therapists.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
    <div class=""image"">Advice regarding <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-and-finances.aspx"">financial affairs</a> and planning for the future.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
    <div class=""image""><a href=""/CarersDirect/moneyandlegal/Pages/Moneyandlegalhome.aspx"">Financial benefits and support</a> (such as Disability Living Allowance and Council Tax reduction).</div>
    </li>
    <li>
    <div class=""image"">Advice about driving (see <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/staying-independent-with-dementia.aspx"">Staying independent with dementia</a>).</div>
    </li>
    <li>
    <div class=""image"">Advance care planning and help with setting up a <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-and-legal-issues.aspx"">Lasting Power of Attorney</a> if the dementia is progressive. This enables a person to be involved in discussions about their future when they are still able to do so effectively.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
    <div class=""image"">Information and support groups. There are a number of sources of information and advice that are easier to find if you have a diagnosis (for example, the Alzheimer’s Society and <a href=""http://www.ftdsupportforum.com/"">FTD support group</a>). Access to a support group is easier if a diagnosis is clear because support groups can provide secialist information and links to others in similar situations.  </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Advice and support for other medical conditions</h2>
<p class=""image"">If doctors and nurses are aware that a person has a condition causing dementia, this is also helpful when treating other medical problems. This includes taking extra time to explain things to patients in a way they can understand, setting up safer ways of taking medication (for example, dosette boxes to help people remember when to take tablets), and understanding and offering extra support if someone has to come into hospital as an inpatient for another reason. </p>
<h2>Research and planning services</h2>
<p class=""image"">Getting the right diagnosis is also important for research and understanding more about the causes of dementia. Better recognition of how important and common the causes of dementia are is vital for planning services to provide the help and support people need, both locally and nationally. </p>

<p>Whether your diagnosis came as a shock, or confirmed what you'd suspected for some time, it's important to plan ahead while you're still able to make clear decisions for yourself.</p>
<p>If you've just been diagnosed with dementia, you may be feeling numb, scared and unable to take everything in. Give yourself a little time to adjust. It might help to talk it through with family and friends. </p>
<p class=""image"">Once the initial feelings have passed, it's time to move on and create an action plan for the future. Dementia is a progressive illness, so the sooner you take care of legal, financial and healthcare matters, the better. These are the key things to think about:</p>
<h2>Get assessed</h2>
<p class=""image"">Your local authority has a duty to carry out a <a href=""/carersdirect/guide/assessments/pages/communitycareassessments.aspx"">community care assessment</a> to establish which of its services you need. To arrange an assessment, contact <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/apply-needs-assessment-social-services"">social services</a> or your GP. </p>
<p class=""image"">Read more about how to <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-help-and-support.aspx#assessment"">get an assessment for a person with dementia</a>. For further information, read the Alzheimer's Society's factsheet on <a href=""http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=131"">community care assessments</a>.</p>

<h2>Making a will</h2>
<p class=""image"">It's a good idea to make a will if you haven't already. This ensures that when you die, your money and possessions go to people of your choosing. A person with dementia can still make or change a will, providing you can show that you understand what you are doing and what the effects of it will be. Your solicitor will decide if this is the case. </p>

                        <p>Peter Van Spyk had Alzheimer’s for 10 years before he was diagnosed. In that time, the family business failed and his relationship with his wife Pat became very strained.</p>
<p>Pat and Peter describe in their own words how dementia has affected their lives.</p>
<h2>Before the diagnosis</h2>
<p>&quot;It wasn’t until 1995 that I first noticed that Peter was acting strangely. I thought he wasn’t interested in his business any more. He appointed a manager and took early retirement at the age of 54. From then on, he became a different person.</p>
<p>&quot;It all came to a head in 2005 when I opened a letter from the bank asking for £35,000. I read all the bank statements and paperwork from the previous five years. I realised the business, which we were relying on for our retirement, was heavily in debt. The best option was to go into voluntary liquidation. It took a long time to sell the factory and sort out our £360,000 debt. It gave me a very big shock.</p>
<p>&quot;I went to see the doctor in 2005 because I was depressed and terrified about what was happening to the business. I told the doctor I didn’t know what was wrong with Peter. I said I couldn’t communicate with Peter and that he didn’t seem to understand what was happening.</p>
<p>&quot;We went to Addenbrooke's Hospital, where Peter saw a psychiatrist, and had blood tests and MRI scans. In October 2006, the Alzheimer's was officially diagnosed. I think it was a relief for Peter.</p>
<p>&quot;For me, it was a double blow because I had thought that Peter would be normal once we sorted out the money situation. I can remember hearing the diagnosis from our GP. I went incredibly still, and I don’t think I took a breath for ages. Taking it in was so hard, really. I saw no future for us because I realised how difficult it was going to be.</p>
<p>&quot;We were given the drug Aricept, which made a big improvement initially, though it's now less effective. Peter has been quite positive about his condition, but occasionally he doesn’t want to face the reality.&quot;</p>

<p class=""caption"">Peter and Pat Van Spyk</p>
</div>
<h2>Reading the signs</h2>
<p>&quot;You'd never suspect Alzheimer’s in someone so young. Peter was 61 when he was diagnosed but, looking back, I could see that he was about 50 when he started acting strangely.</p>
<p>&quot;It was his lack of spatial awareness, his lack of comprehension and his slightly irresponsible attitude that made me first aware that something was seriously wrong. He started scraping the car, which we spent a fortune fixing. Also, he twice tried to cut the hedge and nearly cut his fingers off.</p>
<p>&quot;He didn’t want to socialise. Conversations that involve more than two or three people are too fast for him to understand. I used to think he was being stupid. He would look at me blankly as if he didn’t know what I was saying.&quot;</p>
<h2>Everyday life</h2>
<p>&quot;Peter changes a lot. One minute he’s very worried because he’s lost sight of me, the next minute, he’s full of confidence and pushing through the crowd. He also finds dressing himself very difficult and gets the shirt buttons all mixed up.</p>
<p>&quot;I might say to him, ‘Put the kettle on and let's have a cup of tea’. He’ll say ‘yes’, but I’ll come into the kitchen and find that the kettle isn’t on because Peter hasn't really understood the message. Or he’ll put the kettle on and forget that he’s doing it, so you have to watch him. Once I get Peter to do something then he'll complete it, but if he doesn't know how to start it he'll stand there and wait.</p>
<p>&quot;You have to learn to be patient. Sometimes I get angry, but I just walk away and hope for the best. I spoke to the doctor and told him that sometimes I speak very sharply to Peter.</p>
<p>&quot;It’s awful because he was so full of energy, and I trusted him with everything because he had a sharp mind.</p>
<p>&quot;We finally sorted our finances out last year (2007). We can stay in our house but I don’t know for how long. It has been quite traumatic for me. Peter doesn’t seem to realise our problems, but apparently that’s part of the disease.</p>
<p>&quot;When you're affected by Alzheimer’s it's very hard for you and your family not to become depressed. I don’t have children to share the load and sometimes I feel rather low.</p>
<p>&quot;Things are getting better, though. We were allocated a nurse by the NHS who is our link to the team at Addenbrooke's Hospital. Also, an outreach person from the <a href=""http://alzheimers.org.uk/"">Alzheimer’s Society</a> is coming to see us and assess how things might be. I keep putting off thinking about the future, and so does Peter. Obviously I’m at the beginning of a long journey. I’m just trying to be as positive as possible.&quot;</p>
<h2>Peter's story</h2>
<p>&quot;I think it’s a terrible disease, I really do. I owe my success to Patsy. She’s really been doing good. She's absolutely fair in everything. She gets a bit cross, so I try to keep it back.&quot;</p>
<p>Peter begins to struggle with conversation. He says: &quot;If you’ve had a good education then it’s easier to remember words... I was very lucky to get Aricept. That made a difference. Pat said I changed immediately, but things have gone down again.&quot;</p>
<p>When asked what advice he’d give someone diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, Peter encourages them to be realistic and accept their limitations. &quot;Some people complain that they can’t have their car… when I was diagnosed I realised the bad things I was doing while driving. You have to surrender your licence.&quot;</p>
<p>About joining the Alzheimer’s Society, he says, &quot;That’s something I’d suggest to anybody. They really should get in touch with them.&quot;</p>

                        <p>If you have dementia, or you are looking after someone who does, you will experience a range of practical issues. </p>
<p>People with dementia can feel vulnerable as their condition progresses and they increasingly rely on other people to do things for them. It is important that people who have dementia feel reassured and supported, while retaining some level of independence. For more information, read our page on <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/pages/staying-independent-with-dementia.aspx"" shape=""rect"">staying independent with dementia</a>. Although some symptoms are common to many people with dementia, each person's experience of the disease will be different.</p>
<p>Below is a list of issues you may begin to encounter after a dementia diagnosis.</p>
<h2>Helping someone with dementia with everyday tasks</h2>
<p>When a person with dementia finds that their mental abilities are declining, they're likely to feel anxious, stressed and scared. They may be aware of their increasing clumsiness and inability to remember things, and this can be very frustrating and upsetting for them. </p>
<p>If you are looking after someone with dementia, you can help them feel more secure by creating a regular daily routine in a relaxed environment where they're encouraged and not criticised.</p>
<p>Involving the person you look after in everyday tasks may make them feel useful and improve their sense of self-worth. They could help with the shopping, laying the table or sweeping leaves in the garden, for example.</p>
<p>As the illness progresses, these tasks may become harder for them to manage independently, and you may need to give them more support. </p>

</div>
<h3>How you can help</h3>
<p>Offer support sensitively and try not to be critical of their attempts. It can be very important for the person with dementia to feel that they're still useful.</p>
<p>In the early stages, memory aids can be used around the house to help the person remember where things are. </p>
<p>For example, you could put pictures on cupboard doors of what's inside, such as cups and saucers. This may help to trigger their memory and enable them to retain their independence a little longer.</p>
<h2>Keeping up hobbies and interests when someone has dementia</h2>
<p>Many people with dementia will still enjoy their hobbies or interests. For example, if they like cooking, they may be able to help make a meal. Going for a walk or gardening can provide exercise and fresh air. Or they may prefer listening to music or playing a board game. Caring for a pet cat or dog can bring a lot of pleasure to some people. </p>
<p>If the person you care for was very sociable and outgoing, or if they have a large family, they may really enjoy visits from one or two family members or friends. But remember that they may struggle to keep up with conversations if they have a lot of visitors at the same time.</p>
<p>You can find tips and ideas for people with dementia in this <a href=""http://www.careuk.com/care-homes/sites/rcs/files/CareUK_Good-to-go-Guide.pdf"" title=""Opens in new window"" target=""_blank"">activities guide from Care UK (PDF, 1Mb)</a>.</p>
<h2><span id=""#health and nutrition""></span>Maintaining good health and nutrition in someone with dementia</h2>
<p>It's important that the person you care for has a <a shape=""rect"" href=""/livewell/healthy-eating/Pages/Healthyeating.aspx"" shape=""rect"">healthy, balanced diet</a> and gets some exercise. The longer they <a shape=""rect"" href=""/Livewell/fitness/Pages/sitting-exercises-for-older-people.aspx"" shape=""rect"">stay fit and healthy</a>, the better their quality of life will be.</p>
<p>If the person you care for doesn't eat enough or eats unhealthy food, they can become susceptible to other illnesses. People with dementia can become more confused if they get ill.</p>
<p>Common problems for people with dementia include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>not recognising foods </li>
    <li>forgetting what food they like </li>
    <li>refusing or spitting out food </li>
    <li>resisting being fed </li>
    <li>asking for strange food combinations </li>
</ul>
<p>This behaviour is usually due to confusion, or irritation in the mouth caused by dental problems, rather than wanting to be awkward. If you're concerned about the person's eating behaviour, speak to your GP.</p>
<h3>How you can help </h3>
<p>Involve the person you care for. For example, if you feed them, you could put the cutlery in their hand and help guide it to their mouth. You could also involve them in preparing food if they are able to.</p>
<p>Try to stay calm. If you feel stressed at mealtimes, the person you care for will probably be stressed too. Make sure you have plenty of time for meals so you can deal with any problems that arise.</p>
<p>Try to accommodate behaviour changes. It's likely that the person you care for will change their eating patterns and habits over time. Being aware of this and trying to be flexible will make mealtimes less stressful for both of you.</p>
<p>If you think the person you care for may have health or dental problems, get help from your GP or dentist. You could also contact a local carers' group to speak to other people who may have experienced similar difficulties.</p>
<p>If someone with dementia smokes, replace matches with disposable lighters to lower the risk of them accidentally causing a fire.</p>
<p>If the person you care for drinks alcohol, check if this is recommended alongside any medication they make take. If in doubt, ask your GP.</p>
<h2><span id=""#incontinence""></span><span id=""#incontinence""></span>Dealing with incontinence in someone with dementia</h2>
<p><a shape=""rect"" href=""/livewell/incontinence/pages/incontinencehome.aspx"" shape=""rect"">Incontinence</a> can be difficult to deal with and can be very upsetting for the person you care for. It's common for people with dementia to experience incontinence. This can be due to <a href=""/conditions/urinary-tract-infection-adults/pages/introduction.aspx"">urinary tract infections</a>, <a href=""/conditions/constipation/pages/introduction.aspx"">constipation</a> causing added pressure on the bladder, or medication. </p>
<p>A person with dementia may also simply forget to go to the toilet, or may forget where the toilet is. They may also have lost the ability to tell when they need the toilet.</p>
<h3>How you can help </h3>
<p>It's important to be understanding, retain a sense of humour and remember that it's not their fault. You may also want to try the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>put a sign on the toilet door, such as a photo of the toilet </li>
    <li>keep the toilet door open and make sure that the person you care for can access it easily </li>
    <li>make sure they can remove their clothes – some people with dementia can struggle with buttons and zips </li>
    <li>look out for signs that they may need to go to the toilet, such as fidgeting and standing up and down </li>
    <li>get adaptations to the toilet if necessary – you may be able to get these through a <a href=""/carersdirect/guide/assessments/pages/communitycareassessments.aspx"">community care assessment</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>If you're still having problems with incontinence, ask your GP to refer you to a continence advisor, who can advise on things like waterproof bedding or incontinence pads. </p>

<h2><span id=""#personalhygiene""></span>Helping someone with dementia with their personal hygiene</h2>
<p>People with dementia can become anxious about certain aspects of personal hygiene and may need help with washing. For example, they may be scared of falling when getting out of the bath, or they may become disorientated in the shower. </p>
<p>The person you care for may not want to be left alone or they may resist washing, because they find the lack of privacy undignified and embarrassing. Try to do what's best for them. </p>
<p>Find out about <a shape=""rect"" href=""/carersdirect/guide/practicalsupport/pages/hygiene.aspx"" shape=""rect"">personal hygiene</a>.</p>
<h2><span id=""#sleeping""></span>Helping someone with dementia sleep well </h2>
<p>People with dementia often experience disturbed sleep. They may wake up during the night or be restless. These problems may get worse as the illness progresses. People with dementia may also have painful illnesses such as <a href=""/conditions/arthritis/pages/introduction.aspx"">arthritis</a> that cause, or contribute to, sleep problems.</p>
<p>Some medication can cause sleepiness during the day and interfere with sleep at night. Sleeping pills can be used with care in people with dementia. </p>
<p>However, &quot;sleep hygiene&quot; measures are best for people with dementia – for example, no naps during the day, regular bedtimes and avoiding alcohol or caffeine at night.</p>

<h2>Taking care of your own wellbeing</h2>
<p>If you or a family member has dementia, you may find it difficult to stay positive. Remember that you are not alone, and that help and support is available. Talk to someone about your worries. This could be a family member or friend, a member of your local dementia support group, or your GP can refer you to a counsellor in your area.</p>
<p>It is important for a carer's physical health and psychological wellbeing that they are able to take a break (respite) from care. Carers may also need <a shape=""rect"" href=""/CarersDirect/yourself/timeoff/Pages/Overview.aspx"" shape=""rect"">respite care</a> if they have to go into hospital or meet other important commitments.</p>
<p>Friends, relatives and neighbours can provide respite care at home. You can also arrange home respite care through <a shape=""rect"" href=""/CarersDirect/guide/practicalsupport/Pages/Homecare.aspx"" shape=""rect"">home care</a> agencies or, in some areas, your local authority. Care away from home can confuse some people with dementia, both while they are away and when they come back. If you decide on respite care away from the person's home, it is a good idea to visit beforehand to check that it meets the needs of the person with dementia.</p>
<p>Caring for someone with dementia can be frustrating and stressful at times, but there are many organisations that can help. For more details, call Carers Direct on 0300 123 1053. Lines are open 9am-8pm Monday to Friday and 11am-4pm on weekends, or <a href=""/aboutNHSChoices/aboutnhschoices/find-and-choose-services/Pages/about-find-services.aspx"">search the directory for carer support organisations near you</a>.</p>

<p>If you're becoming increasingly forgetful, particularly if you're over the age of 65, it may be a good idea to talk to your GP about the early signs of dementia. </p>
<p>As you get older, you may find that memory loss becomes a problem. It's normal for your memory to be affected by age, stress, tiredness, or certain illnesses and medications. This can be annoying if it happens occasionally, but if it's affecting your daily life or is worrying you or someone you know, you should seek help from your GP.</p>

<h3>How common is dementia?</h3>
<p>According to the <a href=""http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/infographic"">Alzheimer's Society</a> there are around 800,000 people in the UK with dementia. One in three people over 65 will develop dementia, and two-thirds of people with dementia are women.</p>
<p>The number of people with dementia is increasing because people are living longer. It is estimated that by 2021, the number of people with dementia in the UK will have increased to around 1 million.</p>
</div>

<h2>What is dementia?</h2>
<p>Dementia is a common condition that affects about 800,000 people in the UK. Your risk of developing dementia increases as you get older, and the condition usually occurs in people over the age of 65.</p>
<p>Dementia is a syndrome (a group of related symptoms) associated with an ongoing decline of the brain and its abilities. This includes problems with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>memory loss </li>
    <li>thinking speed </li>
    <li>mental agility </li>
    <li>language </li>
    <li>understanding </li>
    <li>judgement </li>
</ul>
<p>People with dementia can become apathetic or uninterested in their usual activities, and have problems <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-behaviour.aspx"">controlling their emotions</a>. They may also find social situations challenging, lose interest in <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/relationships-and-dementia.aspx"">socialising</a>, and aspects of their personality may change.</p>
<p>A person with dementia may lose empathy (understanding and compassion), they may see or hear things that other people do not (<a href=""/conditions/psychosis/pages/introduction.aspx"">hallucinations</a>), or they may make false claims or statements. </p>
<p>As dementia affects a person's mental abilities, they may find planning and organising difficult. <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/staying-independent-with-dementia.aspx"">Maintaining their independence</a> may also become a problem. A person with dementia will therefore usually need help from friends or relatives, including help with <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-diagnosis-plan.aspx"">decision making</a>.</p>
<p>Your GP will discuss the possible causes of memory loss with you, including dementia. Other symptoms can include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>increasing difficulties with tasks and activities that require concentration and planning </li>
    <li><a href=""/conditions/depression/pages/introduction.aspx"">depression</a> </li>
    <li>changes in personality and mood </li>
    <li>periods of mental confusion </li>
    <li>difficulty finding the right words </li>
</ul>
<p>Most types of dementia can't be cured, but if it is detected early there are ways you can slow it down and maintain mental function.</p>

<h3>How common is dementia?</h3>
<p>According to the <a href=""http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/infographic"">Alzheimer's Society</a> there are around 800,000 people in the UK with dementia. One in three people over 65 will develop dementia, and two-thirds of people with dementia are women.</p>
<p>The number of people with dementia is increasing because people are living longer. It is estimated that by 2021, the number of people with dementia in the UK will have increased to around 1 million.</p>

<h2>What is dementia?</h2>
<p>Dementia is a common condition that affects about 800,000 people in the UK. Your risk of developing dementia increases as you get older, and the condition usually occurs in people over the age of 65.</p>
<p>Dementia is a syndrome (a group of related symptoms) associated with an ongoing decline of the brain and its abilities. This includes problems with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>memory loss </li>
    <li>thinking speed </li>
    <li>mental agility </li>
    <li>language </li>
    <li>understanding </li>
    <li>judgement </li>
</ul>
<p>People with dementia can become apathetic or uninterested in their usual activities, and have problems <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-behaviour.aspx"">controlling their emotions</a>. They may also find social situations challenging, lose interest in <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/relationships-and-dementia.aspx"">socialising</a>, and aspects of their personality may change.</p>
<p>A person with dementia may lose empathy (understanding and compassion), they may see or hear things that other people do not (<a href=""/conditions/psychosis/pages/introduction.aspx"">hallucinations</a>), or they may make false claims or statements. </p>
<p>As dementia affects a person's mental abilities, they may find planning and organising difficult. <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/staying-independent-with-dementia.aspx"">Maintaining their independence</a> may also become a problem. A person with dementia will therefore usually need help from friends or relatives, including help with <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-diagnosis-plan.aspx"">decision making</a>.</p>
<p>Your GP will discuss the possible causes of memory loss with you, including dementia. Other symptoms can include:</p>

Read our practical advice, including where to turn for help.","
                        <div class=""imagedivright-1col""><img alt="""" style=""border-bottom:0px solid;border-left:0px solid;border-top:0px solid;border-right:0px solid"" src=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/PublishingImages/behaviour-changes_171x200_71335432.jpg""></div>
<p>Dementia can have a big impact on a person’s behaviour. It can make them feel anxious, lost, confused and frustrated. Although each person with dementia handles these feelings in their own way, certain behaviour is common in people with the disease. This includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>repeating questions or carrying out an activity over and over again </li>
    <li>walking and pacing up and down </li>
    <li>aggression, shouting and screaming </li>
    <li>becoming suspicious of other people </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are experiencing these kinds of behaviour, or are looking after someone who behaves in this way, it's important to remember that this is <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-and-communication.aspx"">an attempt to communicate how they're feeling</a> and that they are not being deliberately difficult. If you stay calm and work out why they're expressing themselves in this way, you may be able to calm them down.</p>
<p>If you recognise early warning signs, you may be able to prevent behavioural outbursts. Some people find that a distraction can focus a person’s energies elsewhere and prevent them from displaying challenging behaviour. </p>
<p>Your doctor may recommend behavioural therapies to help the person with dementia cope with their feelings. These therapies can be straightforward. For example, they may behave in a particular way because they're bored and have built up too much energy, and a routine involving regular exercise could help solve both of these issues. </p>
<p>Find out <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/living-well-with-dementia.aspx"">how to live well with dementia</a> and what you can do to stay active.</p>
<h2><span id=""#repetitive behaviour""></span>Repetitive behaviour in dementia</h2>
<p>People with dementia often repeat questions or carry out certain actions over and over again. This may be due to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>memory loss </li>
    <li>boredom </li>
    <li>anxiety </li>
    <li>side effects of medication </li>
</ul>
<p>If you think they're bored, try engaging them in an activity they enjoy, such as listening to music. Most people with dementia feel anxious at some point and will need to be reassured of your love and support. If you're concerned about the medication the person you care for is taking, contact their GP for advice.</p>
<p>Walking or pacing up and down is common behaviour in people with dementia. It's very common for people at certain stages of dementia to pace up and down or leave their homes for long walks. This is a phase that doesn’t usually continue for long.</p>
<p>The reasons why they do this may not be obvious, but they may leave the house intending to go to the shops, or visit a friend and then simply forget where they're going. They may be bored or uncomfortable sitting at home and want to use up some energy. Or they may simply be confused about what they should be doing and where they should be.</p>
<p>If you notice them leaving, you might want to accompany them to guide them and make sure they don't end up being distressed.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid of talking to local shopkeepers and neighbours you trust to let them know about the person's dementia. Give them a contact number to call if they're concerned about the person’s behaviour. If you're lucky, you may find that your area is part of a &quot;<a href=""http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=1843"">dementia-friendly community</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>Tracking devices and alarm systems (<a href=""/Planners/Yourhealth/Pages/Telecare.aspx"">telecare</a>) won't solve all your worries about someone with dementia, but may give you some piece of mind.</p>
<h2><span id=""#aggression""></span>People with dementia may be aggressive</h2>
<p>Aggressive behaviour is a known symptom of dementia. This can be particularly scary and upsetting when it is out of character. Seeing a loved one's personality change is distressing, and may be a far more upsetting effect of dementia than memory loss.</p>
<p>The most common form of aggression is shouting, screaming or using offensive language, including continually calling out for someone, shouting the same word or repetitive screaming.</p>
<p>There are many causes of aggressive behaviour in dementia, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>fear or humiliation </li>
    <li>frustration with a situation </li>
    <li>depression </li>
    <li>no other way to express themselves </li>
    <li>loss of judgement </li>
    <li>loss of inhibitions and self-control </li>
</ul>
<p>It's worth keeping a note of anything that has triggered someone's aggressive behaviour. This may involve some trial and error, but if you can identify these triggers, you may be able to avoid them. </p>
<p>During an episode of aggression, try not to make the situation worse by arguing or adopting an aggressive pose as this may make them lash out. It may help to count to 10 or remove yourself from the situation by leaving the room. One way to stay calm is to remember that even if the aggression seems personal or intentional, it is because of the illness.</p>
<p>When the person has calmed down, try to act normally with them. They may forget the incident quickly, or may feel awkward. Acting normally can help you both move forward.</p>
<p>Sometimes there are simple solutions to the aggression <span style=""line-height:19px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;color:#003765;font-size:14px"">– </span>for example, a night light can make some feel less anxious during the night, making them less likely to call out.</p>
<h2><span id=""#suspicion""></span>People with dementia may become suspicious of others</h2>
<p>Dementia can make some people become very suspicious. This can be due to memory loss, lack of recognition of familiar faces and general confusion caused by the effects of the disease on the brain.</p>
<p>The person you care for may accuse you or their friends and neighbours of taking their possessions. They may believe that everyone is out to get them. If they lose items, they may panic and convince themselves that they have been burgled. Their behaviour may seem delusional and paranoid, but as their carer, try to remember that the way they feel is very real.</p>
<p>Listen to their worries, calm them down and, if you're sure their suspicions are unfounded, try to change the subject.  </p>
<h2>Drug treatment for dementia-related behaviour</h2>
<p>In extreme circumstances <span style=""line-height:19px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;color:#003765;font-size:14px"">– </span>for example, if the person’s behaviour is harmful to themselves or others, and all methods of calming them have been tried <span style=""line-height:19px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;color:#003765;font-size:14px"">– </span>a doctor may prescribe medication. If you want information about drugs to help manage behavioural symptoms of dementia, or if you're concerned about the side effects of medication, speak to the person’s GP.</p>
<h2>If you are looking after someone with dementia</h2>
<p>It may help to talk to someone about how you're feeling. If you want to speak to other carers in similar situations, contact a local carers' support group or a specialist dementia organisation. To find out what's available in your area, contact Carers Direct on 0300 123 1053. Lines are open 9am-8pm Monday to Friday and 11am-4pm on weekends; closed bank holidays.</p>

</div>
<p>As dementia progresses, your relationships are almost certain to change. From a carer's point of view, you may find the person with dementia becomes unable to perform certain tasks or roles that they once did, such as handling bills or general household tasks. Therefore, it’s important to <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-diagnosis-plan.aspx"">start making plans</a> as soon as possible after a dementia diagnosis.</p>
<p>We need to communicate to express our needs, likes and dislikes. If communication is a problem, then it can be very frustrating for the person involved, and may result in them <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-behaviour.aspx"">behaving in a challenging way</a>. If this behaviour helps the person with dementia get what they want, they may repeat this behaviour in future.</p>
<p>From a patient's point of view, it's important to tell your family and friends if you have dementia so they understand what is happening. If you find this difficult, you could ask your doctor to discuss your symptoms with your family. This way, as your symptoms progress, your family may better understand why you may not always remember them.</p>
<p>Dementia does not necessarily prevent you from continuing to enjoy your <a href=""#intimate relationships"">relationships and sex life</a>. Some couples find that they can still be close even if other abilities have deteriorated. However, sometimes dementia can increase or reduce previous sexual feelings and you or your partner may find this distressing.</p>
<p>People looking after people with dementia can also feel grief even though the person they're caring for is still alive. This could happen because dementia is a life-limiting condition (that is, it stops you doing things you would normally do, without reasonable hope of a cure) or perhaps the personality of the person with dementia has been affected by their condition. Although not everyone experiences this ‘anticipatory grief’, people who do can feel the same emotions and sense of mourning as if the person had actually died.</p>
<p>You may have a wide range of emotions, such as loss, dread, guilt, and anxiety. Everyone reacts differently, and it’s good to accept that your coping method is unique. You can read more about <a href=""/carersdirect/guide/bereavement/pages/grief-before-death.aspx"">grieving while a person is still alive</a> in our Care and support section.</p>
<p>Talk to your family and friends if you feel able to, or other people with dementia. Alternatively, your GP will be able to help you find a counsellor or therapist who can advise you.</p>

<h2><span id=""#intimate relationships""></span>Intimate relationships, dementia and residential care </h2>
<p>Going into residential care is a difficult decision for anyone, regardless of the age or the level of disability of the person going into care. And, although by going into care they enter a protected environment, this doesn't stop their ordinary human needs, desires or temptations. As a carer, wanting to continue having a loving relationship with a partner, whether physical or not, will not automatically stop. If it is a son, daughter or parent entering residential care, they may wish to continue their existing relationships too, and they may develop new ones in their new residence.</p>
<p>Dealing with physical relationships in residential care requires sensitivity and tact by all to achieve a balance between the protection of vulnerable adults and their right to a fulfilling emotional and sexual life.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer’s Society has detailed information about dementia and sexual relationships, including adapting to changes in sexual behaviour, capacity to consent to sexual relationships and what to do in cases of suspected sexual abuse. For more information on sex and care homes, see Carers Direct – <a href=""/carersdirect/carerslives/aboutcaring/pages/sex-and-care-homes.aspx"">physical relationships and residential care</a>.</p>
<h2>A social life with dementia</h2>
<p>It is easy to feel isolated and alone if you or someone you care for has dementia. Keeping in contact with others is good for people with dementia because it can help to keep them active and stimulated.</p>
<p>Some people find it difficult to talk about their own or a family member’s dementia, or want to help but do not know how. If a friend or family member finds it hard to talk to you, don’t lose touch. Make the first move, explain that you still need to see them and tell them how they can help you. You may also find it helpful to join a local group of people with dementia and their families.

</div>
<p>Being diagnosed with dementia will have a big impact on your life. You and your family may worry about how long you can care for yourself, particularly if you live alone. People with dementia can remain independent for some time, but will need support from family and friends.</p>
<h2>Living at home</h2>
<p>In the early stages of dementia, many people are able to look after their homes in the same way as before their diagnosis. However, as the illness gets worse, it is likely that someone who has dementia will find it difficult to look after their home and they may need help with daily activities, such as housework and shopping. The home of a person with dementia may also need to be adapted to enable them to stay safe, mobile and independent. </p>
<h2>Living alone with dementia </h2>
<p>It’s good to stay independent for as long as possible. Many people with dementia continue to live successfully on their own for some time. Be aware though that, as your condition progresses, you will need extra support to help you cope and it’s better to get this in place early. </p>
<p>Talk to family, friends and your health professionals about how they can help you stay independent. They can advise you about how to cope with practical tasks such as shopping. And find out about the local support services that can help you manage in your home, for example by doing laundry and supervising meals.</p>
<p>Read more about <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-help-and-support.aspx"">sources of help and support for dementia</a>.</p>
<h2>Working</h2>
<p>Coping at work can be worrying for people with dementia. You should speak to your employer as soon as you feel ready. You can also get advice from the disability employment adviser at <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus"">your local job centre</a>, your trade union or your <a href=""http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/"">local Citizens Advice Bureau</a>. If you decide to leave work, seek advice about your pensions and benefits.</p>
<p>You could continue to work or return to work by asking your employer if you can change your workload. Your local disability employment adviser will be able to help and advise you.</p>
<h2>Driving</h2>
<p>Some people with dementia prefer to give up driving because they find it stressful, but others can continue driving for some time. To continue driving, you must <a href=""http://www.dft.gov.uk/dvla/medical/aag/D/Dementia or any organic brain syndrome.aspx?keywords=dementia"">inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) that you have dementia</a>. </p>
<p>The DVLA will ask for medical reports and possibly a special driving assessment to decide whether you can continue driving. </p>
<p>Read more about <a href=""http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=144"">driving and dementia</a> on the Alzheimer's Society website. </p>
<p>People with dementia must give up driving when their symptoms become bad enough to make them unsafe on the road. This is to protect themselves, their passengers and other road users.</p>
<h2>Assistive technology</h2>
<p>Assistive technology is available for people with dementia or other conditions that affect memory. AT Dementia is an organisation that provides access to technology aimed specifically at people with dementia, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>daily living aids – special utensils to help people eat and drink </li>
    <li>stand-alone devices – aids that can be used without being linked to a monitoring centre or carer, such as picture telephones and calendar clocks </li>
    <li>telecare – sensors or detectors that automatically send a signal to a carer or monitoring centre by telephone. You can <a href=""/planners/yourhealth/pages/telecare.aspx"">read more about telecare</a> on the Carers Direct website. </li>
</ul>
<p>Carers Direct also has more <a href=""/CarersDirect/guide/practicalsupport/Pages/Othersupport.aspx"">information about aids and equipment</a>, including funding for these, and <a href=""/CarersDirect/guide/practicalsupport/Pages/movingandhandling.aspx"">moving and handling issues</a>. </p>

When you're clinically depressed, you feel persistently sad for weeks or months.","
          
          <h2>Introduction&nbsp;</h2>

          <p><strong>Depression is more than simply feeling unhappy or fed up for a few days.</strong></p>
<p>We all go through spells of feeling down, but when you're depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months, rather than just a few days. </p>
<p>Some people still think that depression is trivial and not a genuine health condition. They're wrong. Depression is a real illness with real symptoms, and it's not a sign of weakness or something you can ""snap out of"" by ""pulling yourself together"". </p>
<p>The good news is that with the right treatment and support, most people can make a full recovery.</p>
<h3>How to tell if you have depression</h3>
<p>Depression affects people in different ways and can cause a wide variety of symptoms.</p>
<p>They range from lasting feelings of sadness and hopelessness, to losing interest in the things you used to enjoy and feeling very tearful. Many people with depression also have symptoms of <a href=""/conditions/anxiety/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">anxiety</a>.</p>
<p>There can be physical symptoms too, such as feeling constantly tired, sleeping badly, having no appetite or sex drive, and complaining of various aches and pains.</p>
<p>The severity of the symptoms can vary. At its mildest, you may simply feel persistently low in spirit, while at its most severe depression can make you feel suicidal and that life is no longer worth living.</p>
<p>For a more detailed list, read more about the <a href=""/Conditions/Depression/Pages/Symptoms.aspx"">symptoms of depression</a>. </p>
<p>Most people experience feelings of stress, sadness or anxiety during difficult times. A low mood may improve after a short time, rather than being a sign of depression. Read more information about <a href=""/Conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/Pages/low-mood-and-depression.aspx"">low mood and depression</a>.</p>
<h3>When to see a doctor</h3>
<p>It's important to seek help from your GP if you think you may be depressed.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>If you've been feeling low for more than a few days, <a href=""/Tools/Pages/depression.aspx"">take this short test to find out if you're depressed</a>. </p>
<p>Many people wait a long time before seeking help for depression, but it's best not to delay. The sooner you see a doctor, the sooner you can be on the way to recovery.</p>
<p>Sometimes there is a trigger for depression. Life-changing events, such as bereavement, losing your job or even having a baby, can bring it on.  </p>
<p>People with a family history of depression are also more likely to experience it themselves. </p>
<p>But you can also become depressed for no obvious reason. </p>
<p>Find out more about the <a href=""/Conditions/Depression/Pages/Causes.aspx"">causes of depression</a>.</p>
<p>Depression is quite common and affects about one in 10 of us at some point. It affects men and women, young and old.</p>
<p>Depression can also strike children. Studies have shown that about 4% of children aged five to 16 in the UK are anxious or depressed.</p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Treatment for depression involves either medication or talking treatments, or usually a combination of the two. The kind of treatment that your doctor recommends will be based on the type of depression you have.</p>
<p>Read more about the <a href=""/Conditions/Depression/Pages/Treatment.aspx"">treatment of depression</a>.</p>
<h3>Living with depression</h3>
<p>Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes such as getting more exercise, cutting down on alcohol, stopping smoking and eating more healthily. </p>
<p>Self-help measures such as reading a self-help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile.</p>

                        <p>Dementia can affect the whole life of the person who has it, as well as their family. If you have been diagnosed with dementia, or you are caring for someone with the condition, remember that there is advice and support available to help you live well.</p>
<p>Even if you have suspected for a while that you or someone you love might have dementia, the diagnosis may come as a shock. People with dementia should try to <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/staying-independent-with-dementia.aspx"">remain as independent</a> as possible and continue to enjoy their usual activities.</p>
<p class=""image"">The symptoms of dementia will usually get gradually worse. How quickly this occurs will depend on the general health of the person with dementia and on the type of dementia they have.</p>
<p class=""image"">Over time, people with dementia will need help to cope at home and they may eventually need <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-and-care-homes.aspx"">residential care in a nursing home</a>. It is natural to feel worried about the future, but you are not alone – whether you have dementia or you care for someone with the condition. The <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-and-social-services.aspx"">NHS, social services</a> and voluntary organisations can all provide advice and support to help you and your family.</p>
<h2>Look after your health</h2>
<p class=""image"">Living a healthy lifestyle is important for everyone, including people with dementia, and is the best way to help <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-prevention.aspx"">prevent dementia</a>. Eating well and exercising are important for everyone to live well.</p>
<p class=""image"">Changes in eating habits can occur, particularly if someone with dementia is struggling to find the words to ask for food, which can result in weight loss and poor nutrition.</p>
<p class=""image"">The <a href=""/livewell/Pages/Livewellhub.aspx"">Live Well</a> section of NHS Choices has health and wellbeing information and advice for everyone. </p>

<h2>Maintain a social life</h2>
<p class=""image"">It’s easy to feel isolated and alone if you or someone you care for has dementia. Keeping in contact with others is good for people with dementia because it helps them to keep active and stimulated. Some people find it difficult to talk about their own or a family member’s dementia, or want to help but don’t know how. </p>
<p class=""image"">If a friend or a family member finds it hard to talk to you, don’t lose touch. Make the first move, explain that you still need to see them and tell them how they can help you. You may also find it helpful to join a local group of people with dementia and their families. You may not be someone who would normally join a group, but being part of a community of people with dementia or a group for families who have a member with dementia can be helpful. You are likely to be able to share experiences and gain insight and useful tips from others who are going through or have been through similar situations. </p>

<h2 class=""image"">Try to sleep well</h2>
<p class=""image"">People with dementia often experience disturbed sleep. They may wake up during the night or be restless. These problems may get worse as the illness progresses. People with dementia may also have painful illnesses, such as arthritis, that cause, or contribute to, sleep problems.</p>
<p class=""image"">Some medication can cause sleepiness during the day and interfere with sleep at night. Sleeping pills can be used with care in people with dementia. However, &quot;sleep hygiene&quot; measures are best for people with dementia. These rules include having no naps during the day, keeping regular bedtimes and avoiding alcohol or caffeine at night.</p>
<h2>Feeling down</h2>
<p class=""image"">People with dementia can experience mood swings. They can feel sad or angry at times, or scared and frustrated as the disease progresses. If you or a family member have dementia, you may find it difficult to stay positive. Remember that you are not alone and that help and support are available. Talk to someone about your worries. This could be a family member or friend, a member of your local dementia support group or your GP, who can refer you to a counsellor in your area.</p>
<p class=""image"">If you are struggling to cope with low mood, stress or anxiety, you might find the NHS Choices <a href=""/Conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/Pages/low-mood-stress-anxiety.aspx"">Moodzone</a> helpful. It contains practical, easy-to-understand information and advice on how to deal with mood-related problems. If you think someone with dementia is experiencing <a href=""/conditions/depression/pages/introduction.aspx"">clinical depression</a>, be sure to mention it to their GP.</p>
<h2>Keep active and occupied</h2>
<p class=""image"">People with dementia should continue to enjoy their hobbies and interests. These activities are enjoyable and keep people alert and stimulated so they maintain an interest in life. Do not rule out an activity simply because you or your family member have dementia. Activities may change as the illness gets worse, but people with dementia can and should continue to enjoy their spare time.</p>
<h2>Self care</h2>
<p class=""image"">Self care is an integral part of daily life and involves taking responsibility for your own health and wellbeing with the support of those involved in your care. It includes the actions you take every day to stay fit, maintain good physical and mental health and prevent illness or accidents, as well as the effective care of minor ailments and long-term conditions.</p>
<p class=""image"">People living with long-term conditions can benefit enormously from receiving self care support. They can live longer, have less pain, anxiety, depression and fatigue, have a better quality of life and be more active and independent.</p>

                        <p>The concept that dementia is a disease rather than an inevitable side effect of ageing (so-called senile dementia) was first introduced in 1906 by Dr Alois Alzheimer.</p>
<p>But after more than a century of research into dementia there is still much we do not know about the condition and how (or if) it can be cured.</p>
<div class=""imagedivleft-2col"">
<div class=""image""><img alt="""" src=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/PublishingImages/cure-for-dementia_364x200_105777211.jpg""></div>
</div>
<p>Dementia charities have argued, with some justification, that there is a lack of funding for research into dementia compared with the funding available for research into treatments for other long-term conditions, such as cancer.</p>
<p>However, there is room for optimism as there are many promising areas of research that may lead to more effective treatments and, possibly, a cure. But there are probably many years, and possibly decades, of hard work ahead before we can start talking realistically about the prospect of a cure. </p>
<p>Even without a cure there is reason to believe that a continuous improvement in the standards of dementia care can be achieved.  </p>
<p>Below is a brief overview of some of the current areas of dementia research.</p>
<h2>Gene therapy for dementia</h2>
<p>Gene therapy is a field of medicine where genes are used to try to prevent or cure disease.</p>
<p>While the theory behind gene therapy has been discussed since the 1970s, this is a very new area of research and there is currently only one licensed treatment available in the UK.</p>
<p>The idea is to stop brain cells dying, or possibly replace them, but it may be several years before human trials can begin.</p>
<h2>A dementia vaccine</h2>
<p>Some researchers are studying what has been termed a dementia vaccine. This would be a medication to &quot;teach&quot; the immune system to recognise the abnormal deposits of protein (for example, amyloid plaques) in Alzheimer's disease that are thought to cause the damage to brain cells.</p>
<p>The immune system would then attack these plaques, which may help slow the progression of the condition. There are several different immunological approaches being studied, ranging from vaccines to infusions of antibodies.</p>
<h2>Stem cells and dementia</h2>
<p>Stem cells are &quot;building block&quot; cells. They can develop into many different cell types, including brain cells.</p>
<p>Two main avenues of research into the use of stem cells in dementia are being explored.</p>
<p>First, stem cells can be manipulated so they mimic some of the biological processes that are thought to be associated with the development of dementia. This may provide a better understanding of dementia. It also allows researchers to predict the effects of potential dementia drugs more accurately.</p>
<p>Second, the hope is that, one day, stem cells could be used to develop new brain cells to replace the cells that are damaged by dementia.</p>
<h2>Psychological interventions for dementia</h2>
<p>These advances in complex technology are important, but there have also been developments in psychological treatments. </p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>cognitive stimulation – where people take part in activities and exercises designed to improve their memory, problem-solving skills and language ability </li>
    <li>validation therapy – where people are encouraged to explore what things were like for the person in the past and how this relates to the way they are feeling now </li>
</ul>
<p>Research into improving these approaches continues and other new approaches are also being explored. These include Skype-enabled support groups and memory improvement apps.</p>
<p>Another goal of research into psychological interventions is to find ways to help manage challenging behaviour in people with dementia without having to resort to anti-psychotics. </p>
<p>One method that is providing some promising results is known as functional analysis. This is based on the theory that the best way to manage challenging behaviour is to understand the motivation driving the behaviour. Often, people with dementia act in challenging ways because they feel their needs are not met and that makes them upset.</p>

          <h2>Introduction&nbsp;</h2>

          <p><strong>Dementia with Lewy bodies is a common form of dementia estimated to affect more than 100,000 people in the UK.</strong></p>
<p>The term ""dementia"" describes a loss of mental ability (cognitive impairment) associated with gradual death of brain cells. It's rare in anyone younger than 65.</p>
<p>Symptoms usually develop gradually and become more severe over the course of several years.</p>
<h3>Signs and symptoms</h3>
<p>People with dementia with Lewy bodies not only experience problems with memory and judgement, like those with <a href=""/conditions/alzheimers-disease/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">Alzheimer's disease</a>, but are also likely to have difficulties with concentration and visual perception (recognising objects and making judgements about where they are in space).</p>
<p>They may experience:</p>
<ul>
    <li>slowed movement, stiff limbs, and <a href=""/conditions/tremor-(essential)/pages/introduction.aspx"">tremors</a> </li>
    <li>recurrent visual <a href=""/conditions/hallucinations/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">hallucinations</a> (seeing things that aren't there) </li>
    <li>sleep disturbances, including sleepiness during the day </li>
    <li><a href=""/conditions/Fainting/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">fainting</a>, unsteadiness, and <a href=""/Conditions/Falls/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">falls</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>People with the condition tend to swing from a state of alertness to drowsiness or staring into space. These extreme changes may be unpredictable and happen from hour to hour or day to day. </p>

<h3>What causes dementia with Lewy bodies?</h3>
<p>Dementia with Lewy bodies is caused by deposits of an abnormal protein called Lewy bodies inside brain cells. These deposits, which are also found in people with <a href=""/conditions/Parkinsons-disease/Pages/Introduction.aspx"" jquery17105362103087973593=""105"">Parkinson’s disease</a>, build up in areas of the brain responsible for things such as memory and muscle movement.</p>
<p>It's not clear why the deposits develop and how exactly they damage the brain, but it's thought they disrupt the brain's normal functions by interfering with chemical signals transmitted from one brain cell to another.</p>
<p>Dementia with Lewy bodies usually occurs in people with no family history of the condition, although there have been reports of rare cases that seem to run in families.</p>
<h3>Diagnosing dementia with Lewy bodies</h3>
<p>If you think you may have early symptoms of dementia, it's a good idea to see your GP. If you're worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment, and perhaps suggest that you go along with them.</p>
<p>Your GP can do some simple checks to see if there is chance you could have dementia, and they can refer you to a memory clinic or another specialist clinic if necessary.</p>
<p>At one of these clinics, you will be asked about your symptoms and have a physical check-up and memory test. You may also have <a href=""/Conditions/Blood-tests/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">blood tests</a> and brain scans.</p>
<p>The results of these checks and tests will give your doctor a good idea as to whether your symptoms are caused by dementia with Lewy bodies, another type of dementia, or something else entirely.</p>

<h3>How dementia with Lewy bodies is managed</h3>
<p>There is no cure for dementia with Lewy bodies or any medication that will slow it down.</p>
<p>However, a few different medicines can be effective in controlling some of the symptoms. In particular, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (used to treat <a href=""/conditions/alzheimers-disease/Pages/Introduction.aspx"">Alzheimer's disease</a>) have been shown to improve symptoms such as hallucinations and confusion in some people. </p>
<p>Supportive treatments – such as <a href=""/conditions/physiotherapy/Pages/Introduction.aspx"" jquery17106898927822445287=""112"" jquery171008962933361141206=""115"">physiotherapy</a>, <a href=""/conditions/occupational-therapy/Pages/introduction.aspx"" jquery17106898927822445287=""113"" jquery171008962933361141206=""116"">occupational therapy</a>, and speech and language therapy – can help improve any problems with movement, everyday tasks, and communication. </p>
<p>Psychological therapies and specific <a href=""/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-activities.aspx"">dementia activities</a>, such as memory cafés, can also help with memory loss, confusion, and feelings of disorientation.</p>

<h3>Outlook</h3>
<p>How quick dementia with Lewy bodies progresses varies from person to person. Home-based help will be needed, and some people will eventually need residential care in a nursing home.</p>
<p>The average survival after the time of diagnosis is similar to that of Alzheimer's disease – around five to eight years. However, as with Alzheimer's disease, this can be highly variable.</p>
<p>If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with dementia, remember that you are not alone. The NHS, social services, and voluntary organisations will be able to provide advice and support to help you and your family.</p>
